<p class="style1">Lemuria Scene</p>
<p class="style2">
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Oh boy, this is a fun 
one.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yup... it's not 
really a secret, but you're unlikely to see it in a regular gameplay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I gotta be really 
obtuse to get this one.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Kraden blowing his 
stack... now that's quite something.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oh, he used to blow 
his stack at me all the time!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Yeah. Sigh...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Suddenly, I feel 
overwhelming sympathy for the poor old sage...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Weird how we say 
nothing if we go there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Yup. Guess once that 
shmuck dropped dead, we didn't care anymore.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Still, we could have 
at least said something.</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">In Lemuria, when you approach the entrance to the town, you 
will talk with the two people standing guard. Why they have people standing 
guard despite the fact they haven&#39;t had visitors in about a hundred years, I 
have no idea. I guess since Lemurians are so bored, standing guard for no reason 
just seems like a really fun activity. It&#39;s not like they have anything better 
to do.</p>
<p class="style2">Anyway, one of the guards will ask you if they have your word.</p>
<p class="style2">Upon saying yes, Kraden exclaims &quot;Ooo! Ooo! Finally! What 
could be waiting for me in Lemuria? I can&#39;t wait another moment!&quot;</p>
<p class="style2">If you say no, Kraden will instead say &quot;We&#39;ve come a long way to 
see Lemuria. I won&#39;t have anything ruin it for me now!&quot;</p>
<p class="style2">However, it is possible to unlock a different set of dialogues 
at this part of the game by answering certain questions with &quot;No&quot;, rather than 
&quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
<p class="style2">(If response is yes)</p>

To get this scene, you must answer &quot;no&quot; to the following questions</p>

Jenna: Is that where we&#39;re going, Felix?</p>
<p class="style2">
(Madra&#39;s prison)</p>
<p class="style2">
Kraden: This man... he must be an Adept!</p>
<p class="style2">
(Alhafra ship, before fighting Briggs)</p>
<p class="style2">
Kraden: Isn&#39;t that right, Felix?</p>
<p class="style2">
(Kibombo)</p>
<p class="style2">
Jenna: We&#39;ve got to help Piers, right, Felix?</p>
<p class="style2">
Piers: That power... was that Psynergy?</p>
<p class="style2">
Kraden: I want to aid Piers so that he will take us to Lemuria... What do you 
say, Felix? </p>
