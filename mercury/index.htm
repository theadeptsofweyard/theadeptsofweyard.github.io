<p class="auto-style1">The Whirlpool of Love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Ah, the excitement! 
The thought of finding love... doesn't it just get your heart racing?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I... I honestly can't 
say I've given it much thought.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Yeah, that's not 
surprising coming from the guy who didn't know how babies were made.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I do know how babies are made, thank you very much!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Really?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> And yet he still believed 
the immaculate conception story. Please, even I know that's just impossible.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Wait, how exactly do 
you know?! Have these people been teaching you things?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Er, I assure you, we 
haven't... and what do you mean "these people"?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Oh, come on, sis, I'm not 
a little kid anymore. Sheesh.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> *cough* Anyway, perhaps 
we should get on with introducing this section?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> But of course! I'm your 
host, Nowell, and I look forward to being a playable character in the fourth 
Golden Sun game.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> She also comes with a 
hearty helping of dazzling optimism.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> And I'm also pleased to 
introduce my assistants, Amiti-<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I object to being called 
anyone's assistant, thank you very much.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> And my little brother, 
Rief!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Introductions aside, this 
is where you'll find shipping stuff.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Ships, eh? Can we talk 
about my dad's ship?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Not that kind of ship.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Er, then what kind of 
ship do you mean?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Relationships. 
Obviously.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Oh, relationships. I 
can't say I know very much about that sort of thing myself. Perhaps I can learn 
something.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> ... Or you can wait for 
your parents to teach you. Seriously. We don't want to get into trouble here...</p>
