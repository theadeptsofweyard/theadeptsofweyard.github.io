<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Yes, you 
heard correct. We have representation in Brawl!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Sadly, 
nothing so awesome as being a playable character.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Yeah. That 
would have been so cool...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Come on, 
guys. At least the series got in!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> So, what 
do we have in Brawl?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Well, 
that's what this page is for. It's only just been released, so as information 
comes out, this page should be updated.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Provided 
that there is stuff to update the page with naturally.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Man! I 
can't wait to see what else we might get! It's so exciting.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> I hope 
this encourages Camelot to get a move on with making GS3.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Well, I am 
sure you are all excited to see what Brawl has to offer for us! Let's see, shall 
we?</p>

<p align="left"><u>Assist Trophies</u></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">What could this be? Oh, yes, it's confirmation of unlocking an 
Assist Trophy in the game. They work like Poké Balls, except instead of a 
Pokémon coming out, a videogame character pops out instead. Quite nifty, yes? 
The character that comes out of the assist trophy will then put on a show before 
disappearing. It's close enough to a playable character, but not quite there. 
Still, at least they get cool 3D models, so it's not so bad.</p>
<p align="left">The character who is an Assist Trophy is none other than Isaac. 
Yes, many of us dreamed of Isaac being a playable character in SSBB and it looks 
like we at least have him as an Assist Trophy.</p>
<p align="left">And now there is a video of him in action!</p>

<p align="left">Trophy description:</p>
<p align="left"><i>A strong-willed Psynergy adept of the bloodline of an ancient 
race thought to have been lost with the<br>
downfall of civilization.<br>
He can manipulate earth-based forces and is also a highly skilled swordsman.<br>
He sets out to protect a lighthouse that can release the sealed powers of 
alchemy.<br>
In Smash Bros., he uses &quot;Move&quot; energy, which creates an energy field that pushes 
foes away.</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The trophy is unlocked by playing 200 VS Matches.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Music</u></p>
<p align="left">There is also Golden Sun music in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.</p>
<p align="left">It is titled &quot;Battle Scene/Final Boss (Golden Sun)&quot; and is a 
remix of battle music from Golden Sun: The Lost Age, using Felix's battle theme 
and the Doom Dragon battle theme.</p>
