<p class="auto-style1">The possibility of Golden Sun 4</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So, Golden Sun Dark Dawn was announced in 2009, six years 
after Golden Sun: The Lost Age came out in the US. It would come out a year 
later. We were all terribly excited to finally be getting that third game after 
so long. Remember all the excitement? All the optimism? All the hope?</p>
<p class="auto-style2">In the end, Golden Sun: Dark Dawn didn't really end up 
living up to expectations. Many people in the fandom lambasted it.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">It definitely has its flaws, but at the end of the day, I 
do like some things about it. I like the cast, mostly. It's a shame some of them 
come in so late though. And I appreciate that grinding didn't have to be a total 
chore but apparently 
I'm in the minority for liking how easy Dark Dawn was. The me who patiently 
grinded to Level 40 in Venus Lighthouse is long dead. (Look, I was a stickler 
for base classes. I was young. I... I wasn't all that experienced with RPGs. 
&gt;_&gt;)</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Um, what was I talking about again?</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Anyway, so Camelot did acknowledge the possibility of a 
Golden Sun 4.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">***</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b>NG</b>: Camelot also made the amazing Golden Sun. Dark 
Dawn ended on a massive cliffhanger. Any plans to tell us what happens next? 
Don’t keep us hanging!<br />
<br />
<b>HT</b>: I’m very pleased that you enjoyed Dark Dawn. RPGs take a very long 
time to make and need a lot of effort. As you will appreciate if you have played 
the game, the number of ideas that went into the story was rather substantial. 
When writing a story like that for a Golden Sun game, I really feel like I am 
pouring my soul into it and when I am finished, I always feel really drained. 
Everyone else working on the project also really devoted themselves to it, 
treating it like their life’s work. So it really is a huge encouragement to us 
to get a positive reaction from the people who play the game.<br />
<br />
A big reason for us making RPGs comes from the requests from all the people who 
have enjoyed our RPGs in the past. Perhaps if there are enough Nintendo users 
asking for another game in the Golden Sun series, then this will naturally lead 
to the development of such a game.<br />
<br />
Speaking personally from the perspective of the story, I think that honestly it 
may not be so likely because Golden Sun really requires a full effort to be put 
in. But of course, if there are enough people saying that we really must create 
another game, then we may just have to listen to them. Still, you would need to 
give me a bit of time to work on ideas for the story before we could release a 
fourth game in the series.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">***</p>
<p class="auto-style2">I don't know why you would end a game on a cliffhanger 
and then expect people to ask for a next game, I really don't. If you're not 
sure if there will be a next game, then maybe don't end on a cliffhanger...</p>
<p class="auto-style2">There were certainly a lot of plot hooks in Dark Dawn 
that could lead into another sequel.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">That huge Psynergy vortex at the very end of the game? 
Man, that Psynergy vortex stuff sure seemed interesting... too bad it got 
forgotten early on.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The Bilibin stuff seemed interesting too. Too bad that 
also got forgotten about. We never did get to visit Bilibin. I kind of get the 
feeling they did intend to include Bilibin, but ended up scrapping it. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">We have Piers, Nowell, and Takeru all together, as well 
as Kraden's implication that they might have been headed somewhere dangerous.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Someone in Yamata mentions Himi having had a vision of 
Isaac being in danger.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Blados and Chalis are named Heart and Spade in Japanese, 
which are 2 out of 4 in a card set, the others being Diamond and Club... we 
still have to meet them, right? As well as finding out about this High Empyror, 
and the whole Tuaparang thing...</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The rest of Weyard still has yet to be explored. The 
mystery of the Psynergy vortexes has yet to be solved.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">It would be really disappointing for Golden Sun to end 
here.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">A lot of people are claiming that the team who originally 
made the Golden Sun games have broken up and such, though I'm not sure there's 
an actual source for it. I think that's rubbish.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Hiroyuki Takahashi is still around.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">He's the one who wrote all three games.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Motoi Sakuraba can always come back to compose more 
music, as he did with Dark Dawn.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">There is literally no reason why a Golden Sun 4 cannot 
exist. The main writer is still around. </p>
