<p>The infamous &quot;Camelot RPG&quot; on IGN. First, it was listed as a Gamecube title, 
but when the Wii came out and the Gamecube rendered obsolete, IGN changed it to 
be a Wii title instead. It seems IGN actually has no idea if it exists or not 
and probably just put it on the site when they heard some convincing rumours. 
However, this doesn't mean that Camelot's Wii RPG won't become a reality. Could 
this one day be Golden Sun 3? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In the articles listed on the page, we have one from <b>February 17, 2005</b>, 
which mentions a quote from Hiroyuki Takahashi himself: </p>
<p><i>&quot;We love RPGs a lot and we profoundly adore the universe we created with 
the Golden Sun series on GBA,&quot; he replied when he was asked if Camelot was 
making a Golden Sun sequel for consoles. &quot;At the moment, though, it is 
impossible for us to share information on this subject with you and so our 
answer is neither yes nor no.&quot; Takahashi added that Camelot does have projects 
underway and that he expects it &quot;will be able to show some new things at E3.&quot;</i></p>
<p>That was all we had for about two years. In that time, Camelot concentrated 
on releasing Mario sports games, as well as a collaboration with Capcom, &quot;We 
Love Golf&quot;, in December of 2007 in Japan.</p>
<p>Finally, we managed to hear some more positive news from Camelot after those 
two years of silence.</p>
<p>On <b>9th October 2007</b> (jeez, that's closer to three years!), Game 
Informer published an interview with Camelot.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200710/N07.1009.1738.03309.htm?Page=3">

<p>Game Informer was nice enough to bring up Golden Sun briefly, while 
interviewing Camelot on their sports games.</p>
<hr><span id="page3PlaceHolder">
<span id="page3PlaceHolder_PresentationModeControlsContainer_placeHolderHtml">
<p><strong>GI: I hate to totally break away from all the sports’ games, but 
there’s another game Camelot is known for, and that’s Golden Sun. What’s the 
status of Golden Sun, and is that series finished or is that something you’d 
like to bring to consoles?</strong></p>
<p>Hiroyuki Takahashi: First of all, I love that game and I love the world of 
Golden Sun. We think we have to make another one. We have to do it! Not just 
that we have to do it, but we want to do it. Nintendo has asked us to please 
make it. But at the same time we haven’t gotten around to making it. We’re not 
really sure why. (laughs)</p>
<p>Shugo Takahashi: As Camelot, we think of ourselves as being a company that 
makes RPGs. In an RPG you role-play as another character. In the sports games, 
you’re role playing as yourself. I want to let the fans know that in the center 
of our way of thinking the games that we’re making now are close to RPGs. The 
looks and the concepts might be totally different but the essence of the game 
contains the RPG. One of the reasons that we haven’t made golden sun is because 
there are so many fans of the game and we don’t want to do something half-assed. 
We want to give it the time it deserves.</p>
<p><strong>GI: If you did make another Golden Sun would it appear on a portable 
or would you make it fully realized on a home console?</strong></p>
<p>Hiroyuki Takahashi: As a thought off the top of my head, if I could make 
something that would combine the handheld and the console – with the past and 
the future – if I could combine both of those that would be great. But that’s 
just a thought. (laughs)</p>

<p>After that, on <b>November 23rd 2007</b>,<b> </b>an interesting page of 
rumours was posted on Go Nintendo. Yeah, rumours, from a magazine known as RPG 
Magazine, issue number 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://gonintendo.com/?p=30026">http://gonintendo.com/?p=30026</a></p>
<p>Among the rumours listed, it claims:
<strong style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">Camelot is bringing back 
the Golden Sun series by making a Wii installment. Fighting would be mostly 
focused on the Nunchuk.</strong></p>
<p>Not really sure if this is entirely true. Camelot may be making a Wii 
instalment of Golden Sun (at least, we hope) but the nunchuk fighting seems 
doubtful.</p>
<p>With &quot;We Love Golf&quot; having been completed and knowing that Camelot and 
Nintendo both want Golden Sun 3, we can only hope that 2008 is the year that 
they begin working on the much anticipated sequel. On the other hand, Camelot 
may just make more &quot;We Love (sport)&quot; games with Capcom. Who really knows what 
they are planning for the year ahead of us? I just hope they finally start work 
on another Golden Sun game.</p>
<p>Camelot has not been completely uncommunicative in 2008. (These guys are 
getting better at talking, aren't they? It's just as well...)</p>
<p>The 1Up website published an interview with Camelot about &quot;We Love Golf!&quot; on
<b>March 31st, 2008</b>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3167178&p=44">
http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3167178&amp;p=44</a></p>
<p>Of course, Golden Sun came up. Anyone who interviews these guys without 
bringing up GS are heathens, by the way.</p><hr>
<p><b>1UP: I'm going to veer off into a quick few non-We Love Golf-related 
questions now. How come we never saw a Golden Sun console game as opposed to 
just the two that were on GBA? And does Nintendo own that IP or do you guys own 
that IP? I'm just wondering who controls that series' destiny. </b></p>
<p>ST: It's co-owned. Well, I guess...Golden Sun, when we decided to make that, 
that was right at the time when the Game Boy was really gaining speed and really 
taking over the handheld area completely. So it was kind of always a Game Boy 
game. And since it's co-owned by Nintendo, we always planned to have it there. 
We actually did make a game design document for a Nintendo 64 Golden Sun. We had 
planned for the 64 game, but I if Nintendo had delayed the release of the 
GameCube until a year later, we probably would have made a Golden Sun 64. </p>
<p><b>1UP: So is there any future for it? I'm sure the game design would still 
be just fine; you would just have to upgrade what you'd expect to do 
graphically. Is there a possibility that this may still see the light of day?
</b></p>
<p>HT (Camelot): Well, of course, that could be tied to how well We Love Golf 
sells. We definitely haven't made an RPG in a long time, so there's a lot of 
people on our staff who would like to work on an RPG. </p>
<p><b>1UP: So, you're basically saying there's a possible three-way 
collaboration between Capcom, Camelot, and Nintendo: We Love Golden Sun? 
[Laughter all around] </b></p>
<p>ST: It would be pretty cinematic stuff. </p>
