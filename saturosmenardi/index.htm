<p><img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Isn't it sad how 
people think of us as scary or evil?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> I know, right? Just 
because we have pointy ears and red eyes! It's discrimination!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> You took me and my parents 
hostage. And Isaac's dad.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> You robbed our hometown... 
which, admittedly, you wouldn't have had to do if the elders listened to you in 
the first place...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> And 
they definitely killed a couple of Tolbi soldiers. <br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> Everything you did might 
have been for the sake of saving your hometown, but was such violence necessary?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Of course it was.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> We regret nothing. <br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Well... at least 
everything worked out alright in the end, I guess?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> Now we're content to 
just burn stuff once in a while.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Burning stuff is so 
nice...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> I think it's 
time you stated the objective of the page already.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> No one came to hear you 
talk about burning stuff.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> Oh yes, they came to 
watch us toasting Jupiter Adepts, right?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Hmm, perhaps.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Don't even think about 
laying a finger on Sheba!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> I'm not afraid of you!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Here you'll find all 
sorts of dumb, pointless and random stuff. You know. Just stuff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
