<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2"><img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" />Here 
I'll be showing off early stuff from the previews of Dark Dawn, that are either 
different or changed in the final game.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />The one for the games 
with our parents sure was odd, wasn't it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> No kidding. What 
changed this time?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> ... Unfortunately it's 
nowhere near as Twilight Zone-ish this time but please take a look anyway.</p>

<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb1.jpg" width="372" height="315" /></p>
<p class="style2">As you can see, both Isaac and Matthew have swords on their 
backs. In the final version, they don&#39;t have them. Matthew&#39;s sword-on-back model 
still exists in the game data, but looks messed up when you replace his ingame 
model with it. Well, at least he looks less like an Isaac clone without the 
sword on his back. Yay?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb2.jpg" width="374" height="318" /></p>
<p class="style2">At Carver&#39;s Camp, looking at the Psynergy vortex. Tyrell is 
strangely absent here. I wonder why?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb3.jpg" width="343" height="261" /></p>
<p class="style2">During the &quot;Tyrell jumps off the roof&quot; cutscene, you don&#39;t see 
them from this angle in the final version.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb4.jpg" width="341" height="262" /></p>
<p class="style2">This shot of Tyrell smiling as he flies away isn&#39;t in the 
final game.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb5.jpg" width="344" height="264" /></p>
<p class="style2">Yet another &quot;You don&#39;t see it from this angle in the final 
game&quot; shot.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb6.jpg" width="272" height="208" /></p>
<p class="style2">Not that you can even see it in this shot, but in early 
trailers, Nereid had some, ahem, jiggly physics going on. Not so in the final 
game. LOL, Camelot... wonder what happened there. Did someone complain? We may 
never know.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb7.jpg" width="272" height="408" /></p>
<p class="style2">In the final version, Neptune has scars on its body.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="ddbeta/ddb8.jpg" width="264" height="200" /></p>
<p class="style2">Ooh, pretty Psynergy lights. It could be when Isaac and Garet 
are handing out Djinn. You can see Mercury and Jupiter lights there. Perhaps 
they were originally going to give all four types of Djinn to Matthew and Karis?</p>
