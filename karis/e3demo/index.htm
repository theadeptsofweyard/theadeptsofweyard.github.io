<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> On this page, we 
will be covering the E3 demos of Dark Dawn.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> There's some really 
interesting stuff here for sure.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> At last, an 
explanation.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Now that I have an 
excuse, can everyone get off my back?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> No.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Shame they never 
released a downloadable version of the demos.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Fortunately, all the 
demo data is still in the game and accessible.<br />

<img height="192" src="top2.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>These images are shown on the top screen during the demos.</p>
<p>The battle demo involves a three round battle.<br />
<br />
Round 1 is against 2 Flutter Seeds and 2 Rat Skulks.<br />
Round 2 is against 1 Skeleton and 1 Dread Hound.<br />
Round 3 is against the Ogre Titan.</p>

<p>After clearing the battle rounds, you will get to proceed to the demo version 
of Patcher's Place. You are unable to use the shops or the sanctum, or leave the 
town. The Psynergy Training Grounds are also closed off. A few NPCs in the final 
game are absent from the demo. Some of the demo NPCs have different lines to the 
final game. The 
cutscene with Patcher will not occur, but there will be more on that further 
down. </p>

as if the cutscene had occurred. </p>

<p>Attempting to leave the town the way you came in will bring up this message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the Patcher cutscene, it is true that the cutscene does not trigger 
when you walk into Patcher's Place. However, an alternate version of the 
Patcher's Place cutscene does exist in the E3 demo script files. There is no way to access 
this cutscene ingame. Getting it to show in the game requires modifying the 
game's script files.</p>
<p>Salanewt from Golden Sun Hacking Community has made a video of the cutscene 
which can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZZHvWms4_8">here</a>.</p>

<p>So... yep. Tyrell's mother is fucking dead. Another interesting point is the 
emphasis on going to Kolima Forest, rather than obtaining the Roc Feather. </p>
<p>The second demo has you going through the Psynergy Training Grounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="192" src="psytg1.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="psytg2.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="psytg3.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>There is little to do here. The logs can be pushed, but the trees cannot be 
climbed and using growth on the sprout will do nothing. The ladder goes nowhere. 
The two NPCs here, who are different to the NPCs there in the final, cannot be 
talked to but some text still exists in the script file.</p>

<p>These are the Psynergy Training Grounds,<br />
where you'll learn how to wield the<br />
powers of a Warrior of Vale!<br />
<br />
If you complete the training, you'll enter<br />
the nearby dungeon as a reward!<br />
We can't let just ANYBODY in there...<br />
<br />
Now it's time for you to earn your own legendary reputation!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trial itself cannot be accessed from here, and has to be accessed 
directly using the memory viewer.</p>
<p><img height="192" src="trial001.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="trial002.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="trial003.png" width="256" /> </p>
<p><img height="192" src="trial004.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="trial005.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="trial006.png" width="256" /> </p>
<p><img height="192" src="trial007.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="trial008.png" width="256" />&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="192" src="trial009.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="trial010.png" width="256" /> </p>
<p>After clearing the trial, you will then go on to a demo version of the Konpa 
ruins.</p>
<p><img height="192" src="konpa2.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>The demo sends you straight to the corridor. </p>
<p><img height="192" src="konpa3.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>You then have to use Move Psynergy on the gem in this room. After doing that, 
a cutscene plays.</p>
<p><img height="192" src="konpa4.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>The doors open up to a room with statues. Moving the statues to reach the 
other end of the room will clear the demo. </p>
<p><img height="192" src="konpa1.png" width="256" />&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>This room is in the demo too, since it appears in the cutscene. There's 
nothing to do here. The pillars can be examined but there is no text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="192" src="congratulations.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="battle14.png" width="256" />
<img height="192" src="gameover.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>Clearing or failing the first parts of the demo will bring up these screens.</p>
<p><img height="384" src="demoend.png" width="256" /></p>
<p>Leaving Patcher's Place by the south exit/clearing the Konpa ruins will bring 
up the demo end screen.</p>
