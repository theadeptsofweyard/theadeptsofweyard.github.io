Hey, I remember that place... with the breaking down gondolas...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> 
I don't know how it's possible for me to move objects I can't even see... which 
I had to do to get that pesky Djinni.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> 
Psynergy is quite amazing, isn't it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> 
So what's so interesting about the place?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> 
The broken bridge there means you can't get to the other side of the map. 
Unless... you have a walk through walls code.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> 
And there's supposed to be something in this place you can't get to?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> 
But why...?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> 
Who knows... anyway, I'm sure the readers are wondering what can be found in 
this inaccessible area. You're about to find out.</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp1.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">So, here we are on the other side of the broken bridge. I 
guess we can get to Bilibin now! Actually, no, we can&#39;t...</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp2.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Notice how there&#39;s no green marker on the house on the map to 
tell you it&#39;s an entrance? Well, I suppose that would mean you can&#39;t enter the 
house...</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp3.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Except you actually can go inside it. They have even gone to 
the trouble of furnishing this house. Isn&#39;t that nice? Still, it&#39;s a building 
normally inaccessible through gameplay, so I guess you wouldn&#39;t be able to find 
anything in a house like this, right?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp4.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Oh, except for a lucky pepper. Nice to know that the game 
designers still tend to not think things through. So, yeah, there&#39;s a lucky 
pepper in the game you can never get (without cheating). Eh, it&#39;s only a lucky 
pepper anyway.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp5.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Eh?! Apparently ovens are capable of translating now?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp6.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">And so are cupboards, it seems. Well, I guess we don&#39;t need 
humans to translate anymore. Let&#39;s just teach our ovens and cupboards how to 
translate. Yay~!</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp7.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">This log here can be rolled from the side of the house to that 
ledge next to the Psynergy Vortex. You can use the log to hop onto those ledges 
to the north, but there&#39;s nothing there. Kinda strange they put that ledge and 
log there, not to mention the Lucky Pepper inside the furnished house you can 
enter... maybe this area was originally going to be accessible.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp9.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Matthew&#39;s had enough, so why don&#39;t we try and leave from this 
side now?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp10.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Matthew very briefly reappears on the world map...</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp11.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Only to end up back inside Carver&#39;s Camp. Okay then.</p>
