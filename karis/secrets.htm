<p class="style1">Dark Dawn Secrets</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" />Every 
game has its secrets.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> 
This game is no exception, then?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> 
Yeah, we know how much Camelot loves having inaccessible stuff in the games.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> 
I'm sure they have a good reason for it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> 
Well, it doesn't seem to be as bad with this game, but it's early days yet. Who 
knows what else we'll find?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> 
That sounds pretty exciting. I wonder what we'll find.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> 
So... what have we got so far?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> 
Well, like I said, it's not much, but it's worth showing. Take a look.</p>

<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style4">Anemos</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="anemos.png" width="131" height="131" /></p>
<p class="style2">This is a picture that cannot normally be seen in the game and was 
taken from the game files. This location is in fact supposed to be Anemos.</p>
<p class="style2">Was Anemos originally planned to be a location we could visit 
in Dark Dawn? Will we get to see it in a future Golden Sun game? Who knows... I 
hope it&#39;s the latter.</p>
<p class="style2">This picture was possibly supposed to be used in Anemos&#39;s 
encyclopedia entry.</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style4">Items unacquirable through normal gameplay</p>
<p class="style2">
<img src="XXXX_Golden_Sun_Dark_Dawn%20(U)%20(Lolcatz)_19_27890.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Behold... the power of cheating!</p>
<p class="style2">Four items are shown here with no description. The two books 
are actually the Djinn Guide and the Encyclopedia, which you&#39;ll see if you 
compare them. They may have been intended to be items at one point. There&#39;s a 
bag of money. Technically, it&#39;s kind of an item as you can find it in chests and 
get a certain amount of coins, so it being in the shop doesn&#39;t seem all that 
strange.</p>
<p class="style2">The most interesting thing here is the large coin. When you 
put it into your inventory, you can&#39;t drop it, so it&#39;s likely an important item, 
but what is it? The symbol on it rather looks like a sun.</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style4">Unused Face Icons</p>
<p class="style2">Having played through the game a few times already, I can 
safely say these face icons aren&#39;t used during gameplay, but exist in the game&#39;s 
coding nonetheless.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="portraits/briggs2.gif" width="64" height="64" /></p>
<p class="style2">This icon of Briggs was likely intended to be used during his 
death scene.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="portraits/sveta3.gif" width="64" height="64" /></p>
<p class="style2">Sveta looks pretty shocked here. Well, she does get some nasty 
shocks now and then during the game. Poor girl. It could have been an 
alternative for the face icon you see after the Apollo Lens are fired.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="portraits/houzan2.gif" width="64" height="64" /></p>
<p class="style2">Hou Zan looks quite troubled here. It may have been intended
for use during the scene at Iceberg Outpost, shortly before he dies.</p>
