<p class="style2">
<img alt="" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> 
It's time to expose another secret. Whoopee.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> 
It's actually been known about for a while.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> 
Still, we figured we might as well make a page for it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> 
For the few people who don't know about this, it should be interesting.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> 
Kraden blowing his stack of kind of scary...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> 
Which is why you shouldn't go out of your way to annoy him.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> 
He used to get pretty mad at me for falling asleep during lessons.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> 
Let's tell everyone about the secret Lemuria scene now, shall we?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> 
Speaking of Lemuria, why don't we say anything if we go there with Felix?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> 
Because it wasn't scripted, obviously. Yeah, it is weird, seeing as it was such 
a big deal for us in the first place.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> 
I guess once that evil schmuck dropped dead, we didn't care anymore.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> 
Seriously, that's enough inane rambling...</p>
<p class="style2">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">In Lemuria, when you approach the entrance to the town, you 
will talk with the two people standing guard. Why they have people standing 
guard despite the fact they haven&#39;t had visitors in about a hundred years, I 
have no idea. I guess since Lemurians are so bored, standing guard for no reason 
just seems like a really fun activity. It&#39;s not like they have anything better 
to do.</p>
<p class="style2">Anyway, one of the guards will ask you if they have your word.</p>
<p class="style2">Upon saying yes, Kraden exclaims &quot;Ooo! Ooo! Finally! What 
could be waiting for me in Lemuria? I can&#39;t wait another moment!&quot;</p>
<p class="style2">If you say no, Kraden will instead say &quot;We&#39;ve come a long way to 
see Lemuria. I won&#39;t have anything ruin it for me now!&quot;</p>
<p class="style2">However, it is possible to unlock a different set of dialogues 
at this part of the game by answering certain questions with &quot;No&quot;, rather than 
&quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
<p class="style2">(If response is yes)</p>
<p class="style2">

To get this scene, you must answer &quot;no&quot; to the following questions</p>
<p class="style2">
(Idejima)</p>
<p class="style2">
Jenna: Is that where we&#39;re going, Felix?</p>
<p class="style2">
(Madra&#39;s prison)</p>
<p class="style2">
Kraden: This man... he must be an Adept!</p>
<p class="style2">
(Alhafra ship, before fighting Briggs)</p>
<p class="style2">
Kraden: Isn&#39;t that right, Felix?</p>
<p class="style2">
(Kibombo)</p>
<p class="style2">
Jenna: We&#39;ve got to help Piers, right, Felix?</p>
<p class="style2">
Piers: That power... was that Psynergy?</p>
<p class="style2">
Kraden: I want to aid Piers so that he will take us to Lemuria... What do you 
say, Felix? </p>
