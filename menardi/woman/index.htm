<p class="auto-style1">Mystery Woman</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> Another mystery 
page, huh?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> You may have seen 
her elsewhere on this site.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Wait, what woman?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> The mysterious 
blond woman with yellow eyes...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Oh, right, that face 
icon...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> There was a lot of 
speculation about her, but nobody really figured out who she is.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Actually, there's 
data in the game that identifies her.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Wait, what?! How long 
have you known about this?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> *whistle* Better 
late than never...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> So you've just been 
too lazy to make a page all this time?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> Since she saw 
discussion of that mysterious lady crop up recently, she thought it was about 
time to make a page.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Yup. Time to 
finally lay those epileptic trees to rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in case you're still not aware who I am talking about, this is the 
character in question:</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/strangeperson.PNG" width="32" /></p>
<p>Yes, her. The mysterious lady whose actual sprite is nowhere to be found in 
the game and only has a face icon. The theories were wild. Who is she? Piers's 
mother? (despite all Lemurians being blue haired...) Sheba's mother? Ivan's 
mother? A random Anemos lady? Sheba and Piers's time travelling daughter? Saber 
Alter?! </p>
<p>It was impossible to find out from the debug room... or rather, the ones 
accessible with the codes we had on hand.</p>
<p>However, a long while back, Atrius discovered some new debug rooms. I took 
the time to explore them too. </p>
<p>I'll explain here lest that topic end up getting lost to the ravages of time.</p>
<p>Firstly, open Golden Sun: The Lost Age in VisualBoy Advance. (This doesn't 
seem to work for the first Golden Sun game...)</p>
<p>Then go to Tools -&gt; Memory Viewer.</p>
<p><img height="328" src="memview1.png" width="586" /></p>
<p>Make sure the memory viewer is set to 32-bit, then search 0804E130 and this 
is what you should get.</p>
<p><img height="328" src="memview2.png" width="586" /></p>
<p>Change the numbers at the very top of the first column to FD20F7FF, then 
close the memory viewer.</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu0.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>Next, you go into the Change Settings menu in the game, and the settings will 
have been replaced by a new menu.</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu1.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;The menu allows you to teleport to different map locations, wherever 
you are and no matter what point in the story you are at. Heck, you can even 
skip right to the game epilogue and credits. </p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu2.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>I can have Jenna on the world map. Fun. I went to Daila, then made the 
mistake of asking Echo for a demonstration and got stuck in an endless loop 
because Echo was on Jenna and not Felix. Whoops. Anyway... (btw, Echo will 
automatically put Felix and Sheba in the party in case you were wondering)</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu3.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>So, back to what we were doing... let's check the Icon Test out.</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu4.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>Yep, this would be one of the debug rooms. The map viewer can take us to new 
debug rooms that we previously didn't have the codes to access.</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu5.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>If you cycle to 96-99 under Icon Test, you get the option of accessing the 
Face Test rooms.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this page, let's check out Face Test Room 96!</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu6.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>What's this? Why, this is a room full of innkeepers and shop keepers.</p>
<p>Hello there, mystery lady! BTW, if you "talk" to the sprites, you get a face 
icon with a name underneath. This means we can finally solve the mystery of who 
this woman is. Dun dun!</p>
<p><img height="160" src="menu7.png" width="240" /></p>
<p>This lady is... none other than an unused Item Shopkeeper! Le gasp!</p>
<p>... Yeah, that was a terribly underwhelming answer to this great mystery, 
wasn't it? What item shop she was originally assigned to is anyone's guess. I'd 
say she looks like she's from around Angara, but that's all speculation. Still, 
nice to have that cleared up, I guess.</p>
