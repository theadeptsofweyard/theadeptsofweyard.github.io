A link to what?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/karst.gif" width="32"> 
Maybe it's talking about chain links?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
You are both wrong! This is a page about THE Link!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
So we're running a fanpage about Legend of Zelda now?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
*sigh* Not really...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/karst.gif" width="32"> 
So... why is there a page about Link then?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
Because he's in the game.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
... Really?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
And that's what this page is going to be about.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the famous Link from the Legend of Zelda series really 
does make a cameo in <i>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</i>, but this isn't the kind of 
cameo where you easily get to see him. No, it took a fair amount of sprite 
hacking before it was discovered that there were a set of unused sprites within 
the game's data. It is a full sprite sheet that all the other overworld NPCs in 
the game are given. This character could easily have been inserted anywhere in 
the overworld and would be fully animated, like a proper NPC. Yet they never did 
put him anywhere.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="LinkGoldenSun.gif" width="192" height="192"></p>
<p>The green suit, pointy hat and pointy ears look quite familiar, don't they? 
They certainly look a lot like this older design of a famous character.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="1_thumb_link.gif" width="100" height="146"></p>
<p>What was the purpose in designing an NPC with such a close resemblance to 
Link? Was it simply an easter egg for hackers or were they intending to have 
some NPC who looked like Link? </p>
<p>Of course, there are Action Replay V3 codes that will enable you to swap your 
sprites with Link's. <br>

<p>Of course, you won't really be playing an entirely different character. You 
are just replacing Felix with a different set of sprites, but you knew that 
already right? Everything else will remain the same, even in battle sprites. </p>
<p>If you just want to see Link in action, then you can watch this YouTube 
video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoV02vODM6A">

<p>Now what would this page be without some fun pictures and captions?</p>

<p><i>Link... I mean, Felix has reached the Mars Lighthouse aerie at last with 
one thing on his mind: saving the world.</i></p>
<p><img border="0" src="link2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p><i>Isaac wonders who the guy standing next to them is. Garet wonders where 
Felix got his hairdye and that spiffy hat from...</i></p>
<p><img border="0" src="link3.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p><i>Alright, I got 20 Rupees! Wait... that's the Mars Star. </i></p>
<p><img border="0" src="link5.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p><i>Aww, Link won't wave goodbye? What a jerk.</i></p>
