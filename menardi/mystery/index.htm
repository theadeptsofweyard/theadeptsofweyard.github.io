Wow. I have another page about Alex. Hooray. By the way, I am being bitingly 
sarcastic.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
Everything about Alex is a mystery anyway.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Like how does he get his hair to remain in such great condition?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
Or how he can warp like no other Mercury Adept can?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Or even what colour underwear he wears!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Pink.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Huh? What, are you serious?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
No, I was just kidding. &gt;_&gt;<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Are you inferring that Alex is girly?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Uh... I just remembered I have to be somewhere...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
I was talking more about the fact he never made it obvious he was out to steal 
Alchemy...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Yeah, well, how many evil guys come up and say &quot;BWAHAHAHA, I am evil and stuff 
and I want to take over the world because... uh... yeah.&quot;, anyway?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Okay, so what <i>is </i>the mystery?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
What is Alex's gender?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Oh, for crying out... will you all stop making fun of Alex already?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> 
I don't really see it either. Is it just because he has long hair or something?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
This page is actually about a new mystery that has taken over seven years to be 
discovered, dating from the first game's release in Japan...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
Wow, we're still able to find new stuff in this game? That's incredible!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
Thanks to the miracles of rom hacking, something new has been discovered. 
Actually, it's not that big a deal and it's a very small thing.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
Our inane ramblings are just a poor excuse to take up page space actually.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Can you blame us? The games are so old now, we hardly have anything to talk 
about.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
Where's that <i>damn </i>third game? Random reference intended.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
Okay... you have all talked enough, thank you. Let's get on with this.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">So... Alex. Alex continues to be an enigma of course and now 
some very interesting data has been discovered in the first game's code. It is 
also in the code of the second game. The discovery happened with Atrius's 
development of the fantastic Golden Sun: The Lost Age hacking tool, which is the 
best thing since sliced bread. Something strange was discovered when looking at 
the character portraits, a portrait that has not been seen before. In fact, this 
portrait is buried so deep in the game's code that, for some reason, it does not 
show up in the debug room. An oddity to be sure, considering that even young 
Felix's face portrait shows up in there and he never spoke a word during the 
entire prologue.</p>
<p align="left">A screenshot was provided so that we could see this bizarre 
mystery for ourselves. I'll just provide the cropped version with only the 
portrait first.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="AlexBeta.png" width="32" height="32"></p>
<p align="left">Yeah, that's Alex, but isn't there something a little strange 
about him? Of course, I could see it immediately, but I must remember that not 
everyone might have a good eye for faces.</p>
<p align="left">So now, I'll show it next to his normal portrait for those who 
can't figure it out, and I'm also resizing them just to make it easier.</p>
<p align="left">
<img border="0" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="100" height="100"><img border="0" src="AlexBeta.png" width="100" height="100"></p>
<p align="left">Hmm, yeah, they are kinda different, aren't they? It's not 
really all that big a difference. The background is a different colour. Alex has 
a different expression, and you can see more of his head... yes, it's <i>really, 
really </i>small. I'd have to say that I like Alex's normal face portrait more, 
the other one looks weird to me, but then again, that might just be because I'm 
not used to it. Hmm, I guess normal Alex's hair looks a little more green, but I 
honestly don't think that matters.</p>
<p align="left">What, is that it? No, of course not. You don't see me making a 
page all about Felix's younger self portrait, do you? No, I'm not going to do 
that. That would be silly. You can see it in some places on the site. Now then...</p>
<p align="left">There was another interesting thing about the face portraits and 
now I'm going to show you the screenshot that Atrius provided.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="portraits.png" width="148" height="248"></p>
<p align="left">Now then, at the top are the playable characters. The ones lower 
down are of course the NPCs. There is a rather large gap between the playable 
characters and the NPCs. I know, I'm pretty much stating the obvious here but I 
am getting to the point. Notice how Alex's normal portrait is down there in the 
NPC section, but his, uh, let's call it the beta portrait is located with the 
playable characters. Piers is pushed back one slot, despite the fact he is 
playable and &quot;beta&quot; Alex isn't.</p>
<p align="left">In the first game, the portraits look the same, except Piers 
isn't there. Yes, that means beta Alex is there too, located after Felix, Jenna 
and Sheba. So, what could this mean? What it could mean is that in a very, very 
early stage of the game, Camelot considered having Alex be playable (like Felix, 
Jenna and Sheba. Felix and Sheba could be added as party members in the first 
game too), but then scrapped that idea and redrew his portrait for some reason 
when they made him an NPC.</p>
<p align="left">There is no other data to suggest that Alex was playable. He had 
no battle sprites, but then again, Felix and Sheba didn't in the first game 
either, they were just assigned Vermin sprites. Still, I think Alex must have 
been scrapped as a player character very early on, since he can't be added as a 
party member at all.</p>
<p align="left">It does make sense that Camelot might have thought of having 
Alex be the Mercury Adept of Felix's party, but then they apparently changed 
their minds about that and created Piers for the second game.</p>
<p align="left">So, yeah, that's about it.</p>
<p align="left">Just as well, anyway. Can you imagine if Alex had just been 
someone who joined your party in the second game anyway?</p>
<p align="left">
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32"> 
Some random person knows more than you all do!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Some random person?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
Uh, who is some random person?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32"> 
He is some random person and he knows that the lights from the beacons will 
gather on Mt. Aleph and the Golden Sun will form!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
Is that the source of Alchemy?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> 
And some random person wants that?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
No... that's awful... I can't believe some random person would do that... I feel 
sick... disgusted...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
So some random person we've never even heard of or met is trying to take over 
the world. Yippee.</p>
<p align="left">Uh... yeah, anyway, nobody else could be as cool as Alex when it 
comes to the whole &quot;I'm secretly out for ultimate power&quot; thing in my opinion. 
And just think, if Alex had been playable, Piers would have had no reason to 
exist! *gasp*</p>
<p align="left">... I actually had a dream once where Piers was the one going 
up Mt. Aleph. Yeah. o_o</p>
<p align="left">Okay, I'm out of stuff to say, so back to random Adepts 
conversation...</p>
<p align="left">Or, not just yet, as new evidence has been unearthed. It was 
right under our noses this whole time and yet it took years for it to be 
noticed. I can't claim credit for the discovery, that goes to someone on The 
Cutting Room Floor, since that's where I saw it. Anyway, let's begin.</p>
<p align="left"><img height="160" src="pc07_1.png" width="240"></p>
<p align="left">This is PC07, who comes after Felix, Jenna, and Sheba, and can 
be added to the party in Golden Sun, just like the other three. Same as Felix 
and Sheba, no sprite and no stats.</p>
<p align="left"><img height="160" src="pc07_2.png" width="240"></p>
<p align="left"><img height="160" src="pc07_3.png" width="240"></p>
<p align="left">No face icon here, it just shows the last face icon to be viewed 
(I just brought up Ivan and Garet's by cycling between them)</p>
<p align="left"><img height="160" src="pc07_4.png" width="240"></p>
<p align="left">And of course, PC07 is represented by a Vermin in battle. Well, 
geez, that's nothing surprising, is it? It was the same with Felix and Sheba. I 
could look at the character status screens in battle but surely that's not going 
to show anything interesting...</p>
<p align="left"><img height="160" src="pc07_5.png" width="240"></p>
<p align="left">Damn. It was there all along. Alex's beta portrait is actually 
attached to PC07, but only on the battle status menu. That glitchiness in the 
lower right corner is where a battle sprite would normally be shown. To think 
this was here all along. The beta Alex portrait could actually be viewed ingame 
and it took this long to find out. Dang. Well, that's a nice find for sure. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
Well... that is weird. Can we use it as proof I'm not evil?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
What are you, crazy?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
You've got to be kidding us...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
You are all meanies...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Just ignore them, Alex. They are probably just jealous of your good looks.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
Good looks? Alex?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
That other picture just looks kinda odd...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> 
Maybe it's just me but he actually looks friendlier in his normal one...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
Of course! It's all a ruse to hide the fact I'm out to claim ultimate power! 
*dazzling smile*<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
Uh... o_0</p>
