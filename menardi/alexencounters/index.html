What the heck is this?! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
Its for your rabid fans who want to see you as often as possible when playing 
Golden Sun: The Lost Age. You're pretty darn easy to miss sometimes. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
So? I like being that way... and who's been supplying the inside information?
<br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
Kraden, Felix, Jenna, Sheba and Picard of course. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
GAH! How DO they find me? I'm not safe! I'd better go and buy a disguise or 
something! <br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masked_felix.gif" width="32"> 
Trust me, that's not a good idea, you'll only be forced to remove it or 
something. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
And what are you trying to imply, Felix? <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
You're jerks sometimes? <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
You darn well had to remove that mask and you know it! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
Stop spying on me! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
I also know you were thinking about Mia in the Jupiter Lighthouse! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
Dratted Jupiter Adepts! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> 
Cant get a moment's break when there's a Jupiter Adept around, huh?

him, but after you defeat the pirates on the ship, return and he'll still
be here, THEN you can read his mind ;) </td>

near a bay, with a tower to the east, north of Alhafra and only accessible with the ship) When you try to leave, Alex turns up! Then Agatio and Karst
appear. Alex is travelling with them! Then all three of them run off. Phew,
we don't have to fight them. And Jenna and Sheba get so mad! </td>

getting to the Lighthouse Aerie- you're not meant to be going there, you're
meant to be helping Isaac and company! He heals your entire party- yay,
Alex! You can mind-read him too, hehe. </td>

in pain and Alex sadly heals them, then all three of them run off. If Agatio
and Karst defeat you (shame on you!) then Felix and company are lying on
the floor and Alex, Agatio and Karst run off without helping them. Don't
worry, Mia heals them. </td>
