Um... is it always night-time in the Twilight Zone?<br>

No, Garet. The Twilight Zone is... where EVERYTHING is weird.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
Weird is an understatement.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
It's the place where you wonder if you dropped your sanity and are 
hallucinating.<br>

Um, ok, so this page sounds weird already...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
It is weird! It is the Golden Sun beta/promo/prototype shown at Spaceworld!<br>

That thing?<br>

Yes! And we're now going to show you all the prototype pictures Caz has found!<br>

With some witty comments by our webmistress too...<br>
