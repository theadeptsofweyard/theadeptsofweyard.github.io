Another seemingly pointless page. Woohoo.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> 
Hey, they aren't pointless! Just... informational.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Who needs information anyway?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Hey, now, some people like trivia, you know.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> 
Thank you. Now, some people might not be aware of dialogue changes in the Link 
Lobby.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
As in, the place where you go to do link or monster battles, and can have Isaac 
or Felix talk to us, depending on the game.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
There is no dialogue change in the first game though... since, you know, there's 
no party switching.<br>

The TLA dialogues were written down by Laronmi. ^^ But I decided to write down 
the first game ones too. To be... unlazy. Yeah. Linked Battle Dialogue came from 
elsewhere.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Golden Sun dialogues</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet: I can't wait, Isaac! Let's go get 'em!<br>
Ivan: Yes, I'll always help Isaac in battle!<br>
Mia: I'll do my best!<br>

<p align="left"><b>Golden Sun: The Lost Age dialogues</b></p>
<p align="left"><u>No Felix in Party<br>
</u><br>
Isaac: I'll fight enough for both of us...<br>
Garet: If you don't want to fight, that's fine. We'll do better without you, no 
problem.<br>
Ivan: Huh? No way! Please fill in for me!<br>
Mia: I'll do the best I can.<br>
Jenna: Wait, I say I'll fight, and then you back out of it? What's that all 
about? (She makes a &gt;( face afterward)<br>
Sheba: Good luck, Felix! If you want me, you know where to find me.<br>
Piers: So it's just me. Is that all right? I'm a little nervous.<br>
<br>
<u>Felix in Party and Character in Party<br>
</u><br>
Isaac: It's our turn. Let's go, Felix.<br>
Garet: Hey, Felix, I'm all set to show you what I've got.<br>
Ivan: If you want me to fight, I'll do it, but don't expect anything amazing 
from me.<br>
Mia: I'll do the best I can!<br>
Jenna: Hey, I'll do my best if you do yours!<br>
Sheba: You don't even want to try? I'll show you my power.<br>
Piers: All right, Felix, we'll do it together!<br>
<br>
<u>Felix in Party and Character not in Party<br>
</u><br>
Isaac: OK, we're set, Felix. But remember, you're calling the shots, all right?<br>
Garet: What? I have to take a break? Why do I have to do that?<br>
Ivan: There's something really sad about being told to stay behind.<br>
Mia: That's fine, I could use some rest anyway.<br>
Jenna: OK, I'll be waiting right here. Do your best, and hurry back.<br>
Sheba: Don't you want me with you anymore, Felix?<br>
Piers: Are you trying to tell me something, Felix?</p>
<p align="left"><u>Linked Battle Dialogue</u></p>
<p align="left">(Winning)</p>
<p align="left">Jenna:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) You know, you would never have won without me.<br>
(Not in Party) Sure, you won, but...it would have been a lot easier if I'd<br>
been there, huh?</p>
<p align="left">Sheba:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) Yeah... That didn't offer a lot of challenge.<br>
(Not in Party) Oh, you won? Yeah, that's great. But you still left me behind!</p>
<p align="left">Piers:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) I gave it my best effort, as you could see.<br>
(Not in Party) That was a stunning battle. I was on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p align="left">Isaac:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) Everybody deserves a little credit for this victory!<br>
{Not in Party) Everybody did great! I didn't worry at all about you!</p>
<p align="left">Garet:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) You can count on me, through thick and thin!<br>
(Not in Party) You won? Without me? Wow... Way to make a guy feel unneeded 
there.</p>
<p align="left">Ivan:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) If I seemed nervous, it was only because I wasn't 
sure you were prepared for this.<br>
(Not in Party) You really stayed cool in the heat of battle. Good work!</p>
<p align="left">Mia:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) I'm glad we won... But don't you feel at all bad for 
your<br>
opponents?<br>
(Not in Party) The most important thing is that nobody got hurt.<br>
Except your opponents.</p>
<p align="left">(Losing)</p>
<p align="left">Jenna:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) Wow. That was a serious beating... What happened to 
us?<br>
(Not in Party) Of course, you're going to lose if you have such an awful<br>
attitude about it!</p>
<p align="left">Sheba:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) I was doing my very best. I certainly hope you were, 
too.<br>
(Not in Party) If you'd taken me with you, none of this would ever have<br>
happened. Don't you forget it.</p>
<p align="left">Piers:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) Maybe it would have been better if I just hadn't 
come...<br>
(Not in Party) You should have asked for my help. From the look of things,<br>
you could have used it.</p>
<p align="left">Isaac:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) Don't blame yourself... It was just a bad strategy.<br>
(Not in Party) You win some, you lose some. That's the nature of competition.</p>
<p align="left">Garet:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) Pull yourself together! We'll do it next time.<br>
(Not in Party) What? You lost? That's what you get for leaving me out!</p>
<p align="left">Ivan:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) You should have picked someone else. It's all my 
fault that<br>
we lost.<br>
(Not in Party) It's not a problem, Felix. You'll do better next time.</p>
<p align="left">Mia:</p>
<p align="left">(In Party) I didn't help out very much, did I? I'm sorry...<br>
(Not in Party) I know I wasn't out there with you, but...I still blame myself.</p>
