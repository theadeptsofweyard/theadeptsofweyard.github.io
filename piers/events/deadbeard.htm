<p class="auto-style2">
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Ahh... Deadbeard. 
That one boss.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> He wasn't really too 
difficult to beat.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> He did take a while to 
defeat though. Phew.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> The webmistress kinda 
has a funny story about him.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh yeah, I had cursed 
equipment on and she didn't know the Cleric's Ring existed...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Uhh... did she just not 
try to open all the chests?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> This was in like 2002, 
it wasn't like she had constant internet access and could access the Internet to 
read walkthroughs whenever she wanted, apparently.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I sucked at 
puzzles! Leave me alone!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Uh, yeah. So Isaac got 
downed and she left him down the entire battle...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> And he still gets 
called the potential King of Pirates in her copy of The Lost Age. Okay then.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Well, anecdotes 
aside, let's explain this event...</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">In Golden Sun, you get to access this optional dungeon on 
Crossbone Isle. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">At the very end, all the way down, you get to a ship and 
encounter the secret super boss... Deadbeard. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">If you beat Deadbeard and transfer your password to The 
Lost Age, you unlock a small event which does not give you any items. At some 
point during The Lost Age, possibly after Briggs has fled Alhafra, if you go to 
the top floor of Alhafra Inn, you will find some pirates talking about Isaac, 
who is apparently now the leader of theb pirates after defeating Deadbeard.</p>
