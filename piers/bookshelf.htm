<img height="32" src="../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> You know what we should 
do more of? Reading.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oh come on, Kraden, 
we're not students anymore...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I think I'd rather just 
focus on honing my blade and Psynergy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Who needs reading when 
you can just burn things?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> Literature is just as 
important.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Hmm. I feel like if you 
hit a monster over the head with a thick tome, it still won't do as much good.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> ... That's really not 
what he meant, Garet.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Literature is important 
for the preservation of history. And of course, we must do our best to pass it 
down to our descendants. I know I did my best... though, in the end, going 
against the teachings was the right decision after all.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> So I'm off the hook for 
lighting Mercury Lighthouse?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> ... You still tried to use 
us to gain ultimate power, so. No.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Anyway, you can find a 
lot of bookshelves around Weyard.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> And it's all been 
chronicled right here on this page.</p>
