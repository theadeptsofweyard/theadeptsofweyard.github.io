<center>The Jerra Conspiracy</center>

<p>&nbsp;<p><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Oh yes, the... 
Jerra conspiracy. Okay.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
You don't see so many people using it these days. <br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> I'm not sure why this even 
has an entire page anymore.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Well it does, so deal with 
it.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Imagine all the 
effort it would take to just stick this on the Translation Issues page.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Enough snarking, just 
explain it already!<br><img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> One 
of the debug rooms gave Garet a last name. Despite the rest of us not having 
them.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> And thus the 
webmistress took it upon herself to make an entire page about it. Okay then. <br>

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<table border="1" width="100%" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td><img SRC="gerald.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
		<td>Incriminating picture #1!
<p>This is Garet's name, using the debug room in Ougon no Taiyou: Hirakareshi Fuuin... 
er, the Japanese version of Golden Sun, and did
you know, the original Japanese version had a title, like The Lost Age?
Hirakareshi Fuuin translates to The Broken Seal. Ok, now we have
Katakana characters here.
<p>Je-ra-ru-do. So what does Jerarudo translate to? Gerald. That's Garet's Japanese name of 
course.
		<p>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img SRC="gmama.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
			<td>It's Garet's mother.<p>Notice that the first two kana characters are 'Jera'. Where have we seen them before? Oh, that's right, in the kana for Gerald!
			The other characters say 'Mama', so we have Jera-mama...<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img SRC="gpapa.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
				<td>Incriminating picture #3.
<p>Same thing, this time around it says Jera-papa. Gerald's father, simply 
enough.
				</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><img SRC="brother.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
					<td>Incriminating picture #4!
<p>Again, we have 'jera' plus 'otouto' 
which means 'little brother'. So 'Jera-otouto' basically says it's the younger 
brother of Garet.<p>&nbsp;</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img SRC="sister.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
						<td>Incriminating picture #5!
<p>This time it says 'Jera-ane'. 'Ane' means 'older sister', so that would be 
Garet's older sister.<p>&nbsp;</td>
						</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;<p>So there you go, that's Garet and his family... no names 
for any of them or anything.&nbsp;
<p>So, that makes us question, where did the translators pull out a name like 'Jerra' from?
<p>They didn't realise that 'Jera' stood for 'Jerarudo' and translated it 
directly to 'Jerra' and left it in there, in the debug room... They changed 
Jera-mama and Jera-papa to Mrs Jerra and Mr Jerra, and they gave his sister and 
brother names and made them Kay Jerra and Aaron Jerra... <p>
