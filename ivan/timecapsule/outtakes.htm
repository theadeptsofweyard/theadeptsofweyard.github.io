<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> This is a dumping ground for conversations from pages that got thrown 
out, but the content still remains elsewhere on the site.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> So, because there's nowhere else to go, they get put here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Pretty much, yeah.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> People really enjoy our random banter, apparently.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> It's nice to keep as much of this site's history preserved as we can.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> So, yeah. Enjoy the... let's call them The Adepts of Weyard Outtakes. Or 
something like that.<br />

<p>[Isaac's Mountain Hangout]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Welcome to the Mountain Hangout! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> It's where we hang out! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> And the washing too! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hey, who owns those tatty green boxers? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Those are mine, thank you. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Well, washing aside, it's a place to have fun and talk to each other! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Somewhere to chat. Sounds like fun. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Mountains aren't really safe... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Yes, especially when they are covered in snow. An avalanche might 
happen... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Just don't try anything! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Kay's Archives]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Whoah, we have a new section?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> When was the last time that happened?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Caz actually has something new for the site? Amazing...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> I wanted to put flower wallpaper everywhere... and she wouldn't let me.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Thank Iris...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I wonder what this section is for.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> Basically, Caz's written up some basic guides.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Passing the time until we get more information on the next game is tough.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Well, if it means she actually adds new stuff, it's not so bad.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> Go ahead and look at the guides. I wonder if I could write a guide about 
flowers...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Sis, these are guides for the games, not random crap you write that 
nobody cares about!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> How dare you talk to me that way! *slaps*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Owowow... Sis is mean... ;_;</p>
<p>[Feizhi's Misconceptions]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Hello and welcome to my section of the site, I am glad you could drop 
by. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> So what exactly is this section about? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, what sort of misconceptions? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" />: Sometimes people say or think pretty stupid thing, and we're going to 
poke fun at them and explain why they are wrong in some cases... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> So, it's kind of like if people get things wrong, and we laugh at them?
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Sort of... I guess it's going to be a pretty small section... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Which is why we need YOUR help! Email your funny 'misconceptions' to 
kyarorain@gmail.com! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> They have to be real misconceptions which people have actually said...
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> It also helps if you've seen them more than once, but I guess if it's 
only happened once, that's alright... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> And people saying Alex is evil if he's not or vice versa does not 
count... *cough*Caz*cough* <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> That wouldn't really be much of a misconception... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Anyway, let's begin. And thanks for your help! </p>
<p>[Alex's Water of Seeing]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> At last I have my section. My plan to take over the site begins. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Very funny, Alex! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> You couldn't take over a five-person town! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> You two wound me seriously... I am hurt... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Quit talking about yourself and get on with this! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I am here to show you fanart drawn by Caz...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Really, she just links to her stuff on DeviantArt.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Hey! This is MY section! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> She no longer accepts submissions.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, so you can only see her stuff here...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> But do look into the 'water' and feast your eyes on the lovely fanart 
available! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I thought I was meant to be saying all that stuff... *sigh* <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Hmph, we try to help you and that's the thanks we get... </p>
<p>[Crack Gallery]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /><b> </b>Ever suspected that Kyarorain is on crack?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Suspected? I assumed they knew!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> She doesn't actually take crack. It's illegal, you know.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> But she does like to indulge in doing cracky things from time to time.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Like drawing cracky art for example! Armed with her trusty tablet of 
doom...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> A monster is unleashed. A terrifying monster. Run away!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> If any brave individuals would like to look at her cracky art, they are 
very welcome.</p>
<p>[Jenna's Campfire] (yes, the section is still around. I just chose to revise 
the conversation, so here's the old one.)</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hello, and welcome to my campfire. Here, you get to sit around the 
campfire and hear elaborate stories! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> And necking? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Of course! ... So long as you're being faithful! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> You never know what might happen in the dark... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oooooh! I could get away with... stuff! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> You lot are sickening... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Look at Mr. I'm so chilled, I never worry about anybody but Mia! He 
claims not to understand... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Ssh, you shouldn't tease the poor baby, he might cry... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Isn't this campfire supposed to be more about stories than romance? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I guess it depends really... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Except everybody's always arguing about couples! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Ignore them then... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Hey! I want to join in too! I'm hardly around on the site... *sniff* I 
feel so unloved... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> O_o' <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Excellent, now that just about everybody is here, we can settle around 
the campfire and listen to a story.</p>
<p>[Hama's Magical Portals]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> I am Hama... descendant of the Anemos... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> She's also... my big sister... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> And a heck of a lot of people thought Hama was Ivan's mother! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Don't blame them... she looks a lot older than Ivan... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> And they have different hair colours... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> But me and Felix don't have the same hair colour! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> But you've got sort of reddish-BROWN hair, he's got dark BROWN hair... 
blonde and purple are drastically different... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Uh... right... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Me, Kay and Aaron all have red hair... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> All Lemurians have blue or green hair... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Menardi's blonde, while her sister Karst has red hair... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Just accept the fact Hama's Ivan's sister and let her get on with this 
section! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> Thank you, Mia. </p>
<p>[Uzume's Updates]</p>
<p>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/uzume.gif" width="32" /> 
Greetings, I am Uzume of Izumo... doesn't that sound a little weird to you?
<br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/kushinada.gif" width="32" /> 
I'm Kushinada! ^_^ <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/susa.gif" width="32" /> 
I am called Susa... <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/kushinada.gif" width="32" /> 
Oh, Susa... <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/susa.gif" width="32" /> 
Oh, Kushinada... <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/uzume.gif" width="32" /> 
*sigh* Excuse them, they are a little...sickening... <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/kushinada.gif" width="32" /> 
But... Lady Uzume! How could you say such a thing? <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/uzume.gif" width="32" /> 
... Please. Let me get on with this. <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/susa.gif" width="32" /> 
What is this thing for anyway? <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/uzume.gif" width="32" /> 
Well, Caz often updates but neglects to tell people WHAT she's updated. Thus, 
we've decided to contribute with this Updates page so that the viewers will now 
know exactly what Caz has updated... if anything at all. <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20090204192523/http://kprs.laronmi.net/taow/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> 
What's that supposed to mean? <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/uzume.gif" width="32" /> 
Oh... nothing at all! Honest... now on with the updates! </p>
