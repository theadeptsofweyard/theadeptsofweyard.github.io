</p><p>In the original Golden Sun, he never spoke so a lot of people thought he 
could not talk... but it has been somewhat disproved in Golden Sun: The Lost Age 
=D
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;I knew what I was doing the moment I raised my sword.&quot;

German name: Garet<br>Age: 17
<br>Adept type: Mars (Fire)
<br>Hometown: Vale
</p><p>He's the tallest, and has the most HP, he's also rather... brash and 
quick acting. He's cool though ^_^ Mm, Fire Psynergy... lovely...
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;We've been duped! He used us all! Oh, you'd better 
believe he's not going to get away with this!&quot;

</b>Italian name: Ivan<br>
German name: Ivan<br>Age: 15
<br>Adept type: Jupiter (Wind)
<br>Hometown: Contigo
</p><p>He's a midget, but he's a cute midget. He's one of the few surviving 
descendants of the Anemos, and Hama is his sister! When he was a newborn, Hammet 
took him away from Contigo to Kalay so that the prophecy could be fulfilled. 
Ivan's mother died though because the loss of giving up her son was too much =(
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: :) &quot;Ooo... good one, Jenna!&quot;

<br>
Spanish name: Mia<br>
Italian name: Mia<br>
German name: Mia<br>Age: 17
<br>Adept type: Mercury (Water)
<br>Hometown: Imil
</p><p>Mia's the main healer of the group, being a Mercury Adept. She's quiet 
and caring, and believes only in helping people when they need it. She is 
grateful to Isaac for helping her through many troubles and is fuming mad at 
Alex for... everything!
</p><p>Dialog snatch: &quot;I don't care how many heads it has. Nothing's going to 
stop us now!&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Felix</p></center>

<p>English name: Felix

Spanish name: Félix <br>
Italian name: Felix<br>
German name: Felix<br>Age: 18
<br>Adept type: Venus (Earth)
<br>Hometown: Vale
</p><p>Felix is the one who unlocks the power of Alchemy, lighting the last two 
lighthouses. He was taken captive with his parents and Isaac's dad at a young 
age after a storm struck Vale, then returned three years later with Saturos, 
Menardi and Alex, then they ended up fleeing with three elemental stars, and 
Jenna, Felix's sister, and Kraden as well. He's quite rash when making decisions 
but is not foolish, and is quite stubborn and strong-willed.
</p><p>Dialog snatch: &quot;I'm sorry, Jenna, but... Vale... Mt. Aleph... They're 
gone!&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">

Italian name: Jenna<br>
German name: Jenna<br>Age: 17
<br>Adept type: Mars (Fire)
<br>Hometown: Vale
</p><p>Felix's sister. She's hot-headed and super temperamental, and tough as 
boots... she only cries once in the game... and ends up denying it, heh heh. 
She's the one who believed that Isaac's dispute with them could be solved simply 
by talking to Isaac and company, and she was right =)
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;If you can't interfere, then how about getting out of our 
way so we can light the beacon, huh?&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Sheba</p></center>

<p>English name: Sheba
<br>Japanese name: Shiba
<br>French name: Cylia <br>
Spanish name: Sole<br>
German name: Cosma<br>
Italian name: Sara<br>Age: 14
<br>Adept type: Jupiter (Wind)
<br>Hometown: Lalivero
</p><p>Sheba fell from the skies when she was a baby and landed in Lalivero, 
where Faran took her in and cared for her. She wishes to know who she is and 
hopes to find out at Jupiter Lighthouse. She is such a tease... she teases 
Jenna, and Garet as well.
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;Aww... poor baby...&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Piers</p></center>

<p>English name: Piers
<br>Japanese name: Picard
<br>French name: Piers
<br>
Spanish name: Piers<br>
Italian name: Piers<br>
German name: Aaron<br>Age: ???
<br>Adept type: Mercury (Water)
<br>Hometown: Lemuria
</p><p>Piers is a Lemurian, he's pretty special then. He's older than he looks, 
but he refuses to tell the others how old he is, despite their constant tries. 
Felix and company teach him a very good lesson about trusting people, that not 
all people are bad. He was carried out of Lemuria by a tidal wave, which was 
caused by the rising of Poseidon.
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;You were weeping such mournful tears after the battle...&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/alex.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Alex</p></center>

<p>English name: Alex
<br>Japanese name: Alex
<br>French name: Alex
<br>
Spanish name: Álex<br>
Italian name: Alex<br>
German name: Alex<br>Age: ???
<br>Adept type: Mercury (Water)
<br>Hometown: Imil
</p><p>Alex is very mysterious. He used to be Mia's father's apprentice, then 
did a runner and turned up on the Mercury Lighthouse Aerie, and betrayed the 
Mercury Clan. Mia hates him. He desires to rule the world and be omnipowerful 
and immortal, which explains why he is so desperate for the lighthouses to be 
lit. He is terribly self-centred. Gets beaten up by Wise One after sneaking up 
Mt. Aleph to nick the Golden Sun. Failed to get the entire power of Alchemy- 
Wise One gave some of it to Isaac =) Alex also tried to unleash a storm on 
Vale...
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;Wait for me! Please wait! Wait until I reach the summit 
of Mt. Aleph!&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">

<br>French name: Salamandar <br>
Spanish name: Saturos<br>
Italian name: Saturos<br>Age: ???
<br>Adept type: Mars (Fire)
<br>Hometown: Prox
</p><p>Saturos was one of the original raiding party who caused the storm that 
hit only Vale, when someone made a blunder in Sol Sanctum. He's more controlled 
than Menardi when it comes to temper... and he's a trickster too... he tricks 
Isaac's party into handing over the rod... actually, it was kinda their fault 
for misinterpreting his terms...
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;Don't worry, we'll help you forget!&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Menardi</p></center>

<br>French name: Phoenixia <br>
Spanish name: Menardi<br>
Italian name: Adexia<br>Age: ???
<br>Adept type: Mars (Fire)
<br>Hometown: Prox
</p><p>Saturos's travelling partner. She has a really, really, really foul 
temper...
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;Who do you think you're talking to? You owe us your 
life!&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Karst</p></center>

<p>English name: Karst
<br>Japanese name: Karst
<br>French name: Karstine <br>
Italian name: Karst<br>
Spanish name: Karst<br>
German name: Dinaria<br>Age: ???
<br>Adept type: Mars (Fire)
<br>Hometown: Prox
</p><p>The younger sister of Menardi, hell-bent on avenging her death and 
killing poor Isaac-chan. She's a bit more sensible than Agatio, but not very 
much...
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;No? Well, how can I put this? It's time to die!&quot;
</p><center>
<p><img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
</p><p>Agatio</p></center>

<p>English name: Agatio
<br>Japanese name: Agatio
<br>French name: Agatio <br>
Italian name: Agatio<br>
Spanish name: Agatio<br>
German name: Hagartio<br>Age: ???
<br>Adept type: Mars (Fire)
<br>Hometown: Prox
</p><p>Big, ugly brute that travels with Karst and also wants to kill our dear 
Isaac for killing Satty and Menny. He has no brains whatsoever. He is an idiot.
</p><p>Dialog Snatch: &quot;If you really are the brats who killed Saturos and 
Menardi, then you've just earned some new foes!&quot;
