<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh oh... I'm in a scary place yet again... NO! NOOOOO!</p>
<p>*Alex curls up on the floor, whimpering in fear, believing he is about to 
suffer yet another torture*</p>

<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Mwehehehe... I am the evillest being on Weyard. Nobody is eviller than me!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Why are you wearing clown makeup?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> To make me look even more evil!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Seriously? It just makes you look silly.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> You cannot understand true evil.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Say... that flowing hair and that voice are very familiar... you're not 
supposed to be me, are you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> I am Alex, the future ruler of Weyard.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> This is a nightmare. Right? Right?! *pinches self* Ow.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> I ate a baby yesterday. It was the most delicious baby ever.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> o.0;;;<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Babies taste great with mustard and ketchup, did you know that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Of course not!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> And I just love to kick puppies!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Why would you kick a cute, harmless animal?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Pffft. Cute and harmless things need to be destroyed.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Wow. Do I want to know what else you like to do?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Raping everything that movies.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... I'm sorry I asked.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Being evil is so fun. I've destroyed FIVE TOWNS! With people still inside! 
It was awesome!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Wow. At least I had the decency to try and unleash a storm on an EMPTY 
village.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> You are so pathetic. Maybe if you actually tried killing somebody...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> What would be the use in taking a life? I'd rather just make them do 
things for me without knowing it.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Fwahahahaha! My hands... they are coated with the blood of dead people!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... You wear gloves.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> It's a figure of speech/ Anyway, I'm thirsty. Think I'll just drink some 
human blood now. *takes a flask and swigs*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> O_O I'm scared, Mommy...<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> So yeah, I'm gonna take over Weyard and kill all lifeforms on it, then 
I'll be the only one alive in the world!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Wouldn't that be kind of boring?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Heck, no. First though, I must get the rest of the Golden Sun's power off 
that pathetic brat, Isaac.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh, right. Well, don't let me stop you...<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! *warps out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... *shivers* Was that for real?</p>
