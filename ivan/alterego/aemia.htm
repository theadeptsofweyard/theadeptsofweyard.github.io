<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How 
curious. I seem to have found myself lost in some random place I have not seen 
before. Well, isn't that puzzling? If I keep going, I might be able to find my 
way back to wherever I was. Now, where do I go? Is it just me or is it dark in 
here? Why am I even talking to myself?</p>
<p align="left">*Suddenly, lights shine down on two other Mias*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah! I knew 
talking to myself was a bad idea. Now I'm going completely insane!<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *chuckles darkly* Oh, 
don't worry. You aren't insane yet. Believe me, I know.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-who are 
you? And why are your eyes bright red? Why is your background red too?<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What do you mean? I am 
clearly you.<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eep... where am I? I 
seem to have been separated from Isaac...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And you... 
your background is all blue.<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniff* Oh no, I hope 
this isn't the work of some evil Proxian. Proxians are evil, aren't they? 
*shivers*<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pah! Those pathetic 
Proxians are about as evil as marshmallows!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Marshmallows?<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Marshmallows are good. 
But human flesh tastes even better.<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *squeaks in fear and 
scuttles to corner* Where is Isaac? I need Isaac to come and save me. I'm so 
scared.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *massages 
forehead* This is a weird dream, isn't it? That would explain why I'm seeing 
myself... just not exactly. And, uh, scary me, you were kidding about the human 
flesh right? *chuckles nervously*<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope. *licks lips* 
Human liver tastes really good with mayonnaise. You should try it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ick. You 
need help.<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I need help too! 
Where's Isaac? He should have come to save me by now!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is the 
deal with you and Isaac anyway?<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I love him and he loves 
me too. I know that whenever I am in trouble, Isaac will come and save me. Just 
like thhe time when he so bravely defeated that lizard monster for me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And Ivan 
and Garet are chopped liver? *pauses* Okay, now I wish I hadn't said that...<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mmm... chopped 
liver...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is the 
matter with you?!<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You see, I loved Isaac 
so much that I started eating people and finding new uses for maces! 
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wah! ;_; Where are you, 
Isaac? I need you!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay. I've 
had enough of this craziness. *puts four Djinn on set* I'm going to call down 
Boreas on you and get the heck out of here.<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aww, can't you at 
least summon Nereid? I'd like to try her sometime.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is 
suddenly too disturbed to speak and edges back toward the corner to sit by emo 
Mia*<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniffles and clings to 
Mia* Is Isaac going to come and save us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
need saving. She's just creepy. Why are you being such a wuss?<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I am a weak and 
frail woman who needs the man of my dreams to come and save me when I am in 
trouble.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
serious? You can shoot ice from your hands! You have little creatures called 
Djinn! You can heal yourself! You can summon freaking elemental spirits on the 
enemy! You can wield freaking maces!<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *edges away and 
whimpers* You're scary... you're gonna make me cry again...<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder how I taste?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's it! 
I've really had enough of this! *gets up and summons Boreas on evil Mia*<br>
<img src="evilmia.png" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh rats, I'm not ready 
to go back to Hades yet. *screams and disappears*<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, now 
that the scary me is gone, just what is going on here?<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... well, see, 
we're your selves in fanfiction.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Seriously?<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm portrayed as a weak 
character who must depend on Isaac to save me. That evil self you just saw... 
well, don't worry. It was just one fanfic.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You mean 
there are more of you?!<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't get mad at me. 
It's not my fault fanfic writers portrayed me as weak and helpless! I didn't 
even ask to be born... =(<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, well, 
don't you have somewhere else to be? I'd feel a little better knowing there was 
only one of me here...<br>
<img src="emomia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... sure... I'll just 
go now... *disappears into a dimensional hole that appeared out of nowhere*<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... 
that was... interesting. o_o;;; I'm out of here too. *leaves*</p>
