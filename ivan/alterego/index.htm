<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Have any 
of you ever wondered about your other selves?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? Are 
you saying we have other selves?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is there 
some strange parallel dimension out there with other versions of us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, now 
that's a freaky thought.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, I 
speak not of alternate dimensions... what I speak of is fanfiction.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, 
you're talking about alternate universe fanfiction or something?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not quite. 
I simply mean the alternate portrayals of ourselves in fanfiction. Ever heard of 
fanon?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When one 
person makes up a character trait, then everybody else copies that character 
trait in their fanfiction as well and people wind up confused about whether it's 
actually canon or not, because it's been done to death in fanfiction?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Something 
like that, yes. The world of fanfiction can be scary... are you ready to peer 
into the darkness and see?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? It's 
dark?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Quit it 
with the dramatic act, Ivan. You aren't fooling anyone.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Fanfiction isn't that bad... is it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure, bad 
fanfiction exists, but it's not all bad.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure 
it's not as scary as Ivan is making it out to be.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
even want to know about my portrayal in fanfiction, thanks.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heh heh... 
you have no choice...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? 
That's unfair!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't 
we just get on with it instead of talking on and on like this?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Be afraid. 
Be very, very afraid... *attempts an evil laugh and fails horribly* Crap.</p>
