<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">
Life sucks and I want to die. Why do I even exist? ;_; *curls up in fetal position*<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you being emo again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Yes. ._. 
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheesh... what is it this time?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The cookie jar is empty!!! *cries*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... You're emo because... we're out of... <b><i>COOKIES?!</i></b><br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But... but... I love cookies! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's still no good reason to be emo! You're just seeking attention, aren't you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Such a cold... dark... world... everyone is unforgiving... *sniff*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_-' Do you want me to go and ask Mom if she'll make some more?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really?! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You could just ask her yourself, you know...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... True, 
that.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_-+++ WHY IS MY OLDER BROTHER SUCH A MORON?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... *curls up in sad ball of angst* Everybody hates me. ;_; *cries waterfall tears*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw, crap. I set him off again. Come on, Felix, cheer up. I'll go ask Mom right now!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniffsob* *still curled up in ball* Jenna said I'm a moron... *wangst* Maybe I really am...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's no good. I can't seem to get him out of it... o_o *pokes Felix with stick*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *aaaaaaangst* The pain... overwhelms me... such wonderful pain...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_o *dumps cold water all over him*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> AAAAHHHHHH!!! What was that for?! ._. *shivers*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> STOP BEING EMO!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nobody understands the pain I feel... WHY?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I give up. Here's some Prozac.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not as tasty as cookies... but strangely cheers me up.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, don't take the whole- ... too late.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> WHEE!!! ^_^ I'M SO HAPPY!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please try to stay calm, brother...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Look! A bunny! *skips off after bunny*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't see a bunny... o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh, a lake! *dives onto ground and makes swimming motion*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, great, he's being an idiot and hallucinating. Uh... Felix? *walks up and pokes him* You're swimming on the ground...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *stares at Jenna* Who are you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_o You're hallucinating pretty bad. What are you seeing?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A naked, big-breasted chick with blond hair and sparkly eyes. ♥_♥<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... That's it. No more Prozac.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Will you do me? ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> DRAGON FUME!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> x_x<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, whoops. And it wasn't even his fault...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Were you trying to kill him just now?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> N-no! I... I was trying to stop him from being emo...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> By burning him to a crisp? o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, it depends on how you look at it. He's unconscious, so he's not being emo, right? ^_^;;;<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooookay...</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Would you like me to help you? ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What does that mean?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I was just thinking I'd kiss it better for you. ^_^ And more. ^_-<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... *backs away* I don't think that's a good idea...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aww, don't be shy, Felix... ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why the hell do you keep using smilies?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^____^ Say, it's rather hot in here, isn't it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I suppose it's a little warm, but it's not hot... why?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I was going to suggest we take off all our clothes. =D<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stay away from me, you crazy Lemurian!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now, now, there's no need for that kind of behaviour. ^_^ *cracks whip*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No! I am not indulging in your sick bondage games again!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw, crap.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why, yes, we've done it lots of times. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Shut the hell up, Piers!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *whipcrack* Do not speak that way to your master!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can't you take your bondage somewhere else? *disturbed*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's alright, I'll be taking him to the bedroom now. ^_-<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do I get a choice? D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope! *drags Felix to bedroom*<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You exist because your mommy and daddy loved each other very much and wanted to have kids.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's meant to be a helpful answer?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, it's the reason why you exist.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Life still sucks. ;_; What is the meaning of life?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The answer is 42.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; Are you making fun of me?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Geez. You're hopeless...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There is no hope. The future is dark, cold and lonely... we are doomed...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_-' Yeah, think I'll go talk to someone else now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *angst*<br>
