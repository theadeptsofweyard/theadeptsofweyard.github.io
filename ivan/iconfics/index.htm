<p>I made these from the ashes of an RP community I made, with RP journals I 
also made, and I had fun just making random posts and comments in the community. 
Unfortunately, GreatestJournal committed suicide so I 
saved the entries and comments, and adapted most of them into icon crackfics. 
Beware, as they definitely are not suitable for kids. Yes, they are that bad.</p>
