<p>Part 1 of the Crack Series. It's only going to get worse...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, 
guys, I'm bored. Does anyone want to do me already? It's about time I got done. 
You cannot resist the scarf!</p>
<p><br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am willing 
to, Isaac.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But... 
you're underage!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So? I've done 
it many times. Hammet has a bunch of concubines after all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's slightly too much information. Besides, couldn't you catch something doing that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheesh,
Isaac! Do you want to do me or not? Besides, do they even have a legal
age in Weyard? And according to some places on Earth, you're underage
too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm, that's true. Does Weyard have a legal age? Maybe nobody gives a damn.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">
 Which is exactly why you should do me. Right now. Hurry, before Hammet 
finds out I screwed his concubines and makes me a eunuch!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's actually threatened you with chopping off your 
wang?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not so loud, Isaac! Anyway, the concubines won't tell on me. I'm too damn good.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What would Layana think about you screwing the concubines?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, she knows. It was her idea after all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You have got the worst foster parents ever...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess so. I don't think my sister would be pleased to hear about it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... top or bottom?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh, you can top. Just don't forget the lube.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, do we have any lube?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't think so. I guess we'll just have to find a good substitute.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay. *searches* Oh, hey, what about this? *holds up jar of peanut butter*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please tell me you're joking...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... ok. Ooh, Marmite?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_-' May I suggest finding a <i>non-edible</i> substitute?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, wait. What about this honey?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Forget it. I'm going to go out and buy some...</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Normally, I 
would love to, but I have just decided to become a cleric.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, what? What's a cleric again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A cleric is a woman who works underneath someone's teachings. The opposite of a monk.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Does that mean... you're not even going to... <i>do it?</i><br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. I serve the great Kraden and nobody else.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You didn't go near the Temple of Kraden, did you?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I
did, and they taught me a lot. I have learned the true purpose in my
life. It is to serve Kraden. So, I am sorry, I cannot have sex.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What are you talking about? They obviously brainwashed you!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They
did nothing of the sort. I have learned to love only Kraden. You should
follow my example. We will all be happier for doing so. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But-but... Kraden's a rambling old fart!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah, so you are a non-believer. I will save you from the darkness, Isaac. Have faith in me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not in ANY darkness! Listen, Mia, Kraden is not a deity in the least! He's just a creaky old Alchemy sage!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden is the wisest and most benevolent, someone so awesome we cannot even begin to comprehend his awesomeness. Hail Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you even listening to me?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, Kraden, greatest and most wise of all... give me the power to bless Isaac with the knowledge of your greatness.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> NO!!! I won't worship Kraden! Ever!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *holds up magic staff of doom* I'll convert you, Isaac! You can be saved!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Wut.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *points staff at Isaac* KRADEN HEALING ESCALATION!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Was that supposed to do something?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *falls to knees* No... Kraden... I have failed you. Please forgive me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia. Kraden 
is not a deity. They just really like worshipping them.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> <i>No!</i>
It's got to be true! Those nice people who beat me over the head and
popped me in a sack told me so! So did that nice person with the
pendulum...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sorry, but it's the truth. You were brainwashed into a cult worshipping Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; Can I have some comfort sex now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course. I know a nice, comfy bed we could do it in.
</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's so great about that scarf?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's YELLOW.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's it?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. So, will you do me?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sorry, I don't bend that way. Anyway, aren't you getting some with Ivan and Mia already?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm pimpin' and you know it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's not a very good way to behave, Isaac.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, come on! What's the worst that could happen?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They could get jealous of each other. Or you could get STIs.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, that's possible. What if everyone got so jealous, they raped each other with maces and ate each other?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What the hell?! Whatever possessed you to think of something like that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A fanfic I read once. Should I also add I was the one doing the killing and mace raping in it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> PLEASE tell me you're joking.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sorry, but I'm not joking. Do you think I would make something like that up?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's just unbelievable. Was the person who wrote the fanfic 
a deranged crack addict?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, Garet, 
just a fanfic writer. A lot of fanfic writers write strange things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just can't believe a sane, normal person would do such a thing!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. It's 
hard to believe. But fanfic writers don't always write like they are sane and 
normal.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> On the 
subject of STIs, I always wear a condom.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, okay, but that doesn't really fix the jealousy problem.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I sincerely doubt they will murder and eat each other, like Mia suggested, so I'm not worried.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, pretty sure you won't have to worry about that...
