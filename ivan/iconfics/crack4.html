<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Guys, I've decided to write a fanfic. I've been inspired by pieces of works 
around this thing called the "Internet" and now I want to put my creative juices 
to good use. Please read my fic! It's underneath the cut because it has sex in 
it, so Ivan and Sheba, STAY AWAY FROM IT. If I catch you reading, I'll make you 
pay. Don't get me into trouble.<br />
<br />
This isn't proof-read, sorry. I'm too lazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
title: lots of hot loving<br />
rating: nc-17<br />
warning: sex<br />
pairing: garet(that's me!)/jenna</p>

GARET! YOU ARE DEAD!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Didn't you like it? D=<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> HELL, NO! Whatever possessed you to think I would like a story about us 
screwing?! What's WRONG with you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> But... I thought it was good...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Good?! It's the most disgusting, pathetic and perverted piece of work 
ever!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> You've just described a hell of a lot of NC-17 fanfiction then.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> ... ... ... I don't CARE if other people write stuff like that! The fact 
is, you write about getting it on with me! Are you NUTS?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Ok, let's pretend the guy is some random guy named Bob and the girl is 
named Bobbina. What do you think of it now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Who the hell is called Bobbina?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I asked for your thoughts. What was the writing like?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> You really want my honest opinion, Garet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Yes, please.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> 
<span class="auto-style1"><strong><em>It's the worst piece of shit I've ever 
read in my life!</em></strong></span><br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> ... Then could you give me some tips?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" />
The only tip I have is this: DIE IN A FIRE!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> That's pretty ironic, considering I'm a Fire Adept.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Clearly, you are not getting my message. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> No, I get it clear enough. You want me to die. But what does that have to 
do with my writing?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I don't even know where to start, so I think I'm going to cause you 
serious pain instead.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> But... couldn't I just have the tips?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> <br />
<br />
*kicks Garet in the nuts.*<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
*whacks Garet in nuts with baseball bat*<br />
<br />
... ...<br />
<br />
*slams wrecking ball into Garet's nuts*<br />
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oh... holy crap... the pain... *passes out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" />
*stares at Garet's body*
Well, with any luck, he won't be able to walk for a few years. Oh, yeah, just in 
case. *breaks Garet's fingers with metal bar*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> x__________x<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> *throws Garet's body in ditch and walks away*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> x_________________x</p>
<p>*some time later*<br />
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" />
Oh, there's Garet lying half-dead in a ditch. How strange. *heals him with Pure 
Ply*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Mia! You saved me!!! ;_; *glomps*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> What happened?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Jenna beat me to near death before tossing me in a ditch! ;_____;<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Oh... but why did she do that? o_O<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Because of the fic I just wrote. Here, have a look.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> 
... ... ...
... ... ...
*whacks Garet unconscious with mace and walks away*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> x__________x;;;;;<br />
<br />
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> MY EYES!!! <strong>
MY FREAKING EYES!!!</strong> <em>They burn!!!</em><br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Hey, I did warn of the sex... oh wait. You. Read it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> <strong>GAH!!!</strong> *chugs entire bottle of bleach and pours even more over 
eyes*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Um... that's not really good for you...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> *twitches* ... *twitches again* 
<strong>AIFEHDNDKDSOSFDSAAAAAA!!!!!</strong> *has a 
seizure*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> ... What should I do? Oh, I know! *dumps bucket of freezing cold water 
over Felix*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Aaaaaahhhhhh!!! *shivers* What the hell is WRONG with you?! Wait, what 
just happened?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> You read a smut fic I wrote about me screwing Jenna then had a seizure.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> 
... I am going to kill you.
Slowly and painfully.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> But... I'm being creative! Anyway, it's not like we really did it!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> *death glare, starts sharpening sword on rock*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Aw, crud. *starts running* HELP MEEEEE!!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Get back here! *chases and casts Odyssey*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Wah! That hurts! *tries climbing up tree and falls* Ow!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> *starts hitting with Djinn*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! It hurts enough now! I won't do it again!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I SUMMON JUDGMENT!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> X_____X *is nearly dead*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> *readies Sol Blade*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Uh... Felix, I think you can stop now. o_o'<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> He wrote about having sex with my sister!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> That's still no excuse to kill him. Will you please calm down?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Can't I just hit him with one little Megiddo?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> 
No! Good grief...
You still awake, Garet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> x_o;;; Bare...ly...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Good. Now properly apologise to Felix for what you've done.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> He's just pissed off because he was stupid enough to read it! There's a 
warning right above!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I. Said. Apologise.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I don't want an apology! I want him dead and the memory of that awful fic 
erased from my brain!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> You two are acting really immature.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I'll write whatever I damn well want!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> OVER MY DEAD BODY!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oh, yeah? Just try and stop me!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Um, Garet? Didn't he just KICK YOUR ASS?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oh, yeah... please don't kill me!!! ;_;<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> You are NOT going to write such filth about Jenna again! Do you hear me? 
In fact, don't include any of us in such things! I don't care what you do with 
yourself, just don't involve anyone else especially without permission!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Is that clear enough, Garet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> ... Fine. ._. Sheesh...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Good. Glad we got all that sorted out.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Indeed. Hopefully he won't be foolish enough to try again.<br />
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Garet. Garet. Garet. *headshakes* No. Just... 
<em>no.</em><br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> What's wrong with it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Writing about yourself screwing one of your closest friends? Isn't that 
just a bit weird?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> How is it so different to actually doing it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Are you even in a sexual relationship with Jenna?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> ... ... No. But I wish I was.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh, boy. Okay, that's wrong. It makes it even worse. It's one thing to 
fantasize about it. It's another thing altogether to write it down and show it 
off!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> So, what did you think of the fic?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Honestly? It's badly written and just AWFUL. You should just give up.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> ._. But I like writing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Then... I dunno... GET HELP. I'm not even going to bother helping. 
*leaves*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Meanie. ;_;<br />
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Okay. First of all, SPELLING. PLEASE use a spell checker! There is no 
excuse for not using one!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> You're actually not going to yell at me about the content?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> You seem to have suffered already and anyway, I'm a pacifist. Okay, so 
check your spelling. Always. It's terrible.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Ok. I was kind of in a hurry to get it up so-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I said, NO. EXCUSE. And another thing, your euphemisms. Dear Iris... 
v_v;;;<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> What's a euphemism?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> The words you use for... certain bits. They are... just awful. Please use 
some more socially acceptable ones.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> You mean, what most people use in fics? I wanted to be a little more 
unique.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Well, don't. Sometimes, being unique is a BAD thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I see... ._. Anything else?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> The sex happens too fast. Can't you at least have a little more dialogue 
before it happens? You just seem lazy. Also, be a bit more descriptive and don't 
have several actions going on in one paragraph. Space it out.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> So, basically, I should be more detailed and stuff? And not rush it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Yes, exactly. And author's notes right in the middle of the fic? 
Annoying. It disrupts the flow of the story.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Ok, I won't do that then.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Oh, and one more thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Hm? What?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Don't write about getting it on with someone you know in real life who 
isn't even your lover. You FREAK.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> O_____________O;;;;</p>
