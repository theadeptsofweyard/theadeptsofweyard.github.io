read. Enjoy.</p>

<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba... 
I've been wondering... is your stylist blind?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I've always wanted to know! Tell me the truth!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why would I have a blind stylist?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, someone to do your hair. Did they get a blind person to do it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Does it look like a blind person did my hair?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Either that, or they had a grudge on you. That would explain the hair.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's wrong with my hair?! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It looks like a salad bowl. A SALAD BOWL.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... maybe someone cut my hair using a salad bowl? ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, sue them then! Your hair sucks!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Jenna, it's not nice to tell people their hair sucks...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But it's the truth. =/ What's wrong with being honest?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You'll hurt people's feelings...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pfft. Feelings are overrated.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *shrugs* Dunno. I just felt like saying something random.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... So, are you and Isaac a real item yet? &gt;_&gt;<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> DON'T MAKE ME BURN YOU!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't believe some people thought me teasing you 
automatically made Valeshipping canon.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding. v_v Considering you'd never seen me and Isaac together at that point, why would it mean anything?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You raise a 
great point. All I was doing was teasing you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, 
exactly!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But, the fact you blushed is kind of suspicious...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... well... I was... embarrassed! That's it! You embarrassed me!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But why were you embarrassed?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You know, you don't have to 
talk anymore. Now buzz off before I burn you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wouldn't it be funny if Camelot made that sequel and Valeshipping was canon?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If Camelot values their lives, there won't be canon pairings. Do you want to see the fandom wank?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There isn't much of a fandom these days, sadly...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Which is Camelot's fault for taking five years just to say they want to make a sequel... when are they going to make it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's see, a team of about 20 people, and they don't want to make something half-assed, I predict at least 2-3 years.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ._. Come on, Camelot, we want to see what's next in store for us...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I
sure hope they don't do something like 20 years later and have people
play as our kids instead. Can you imagine what we'd look like in 20 years?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You'll probably have a head bigger than Jupiter. I, on the other hand, will still have my good looks of course. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! ._. You know, Garet with a beard would be frightening. Or Isaac with a mustache.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Yeah, I really don't want to see us twenty years later... o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ew. I'm never growing a beard.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good. Because if you grow one, I'm never having a relationship with you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't like beards, huh? Okay. Is there anything else you don't like?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Facial hair in general. Just don't grow anything on your face and we're fine.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If Camelot wants to make their characters look 20 years older, they will.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But, a beard? Gimme a freaking break!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *dies in 
horror at thought of having a mustache*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm trying to imagine you with a mustache. I can't.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> x_x<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Well, for your sakes, I'm hoping a sequel won't be some years later then...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> IT BETTER WELL NOT BE.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why must you scar us?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's fun.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or Camelot might even do something a thousand years later, still on Weyard, to show us how Alchemy affected it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But we'll be dead 
by then. Except Piers, maybe.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, who knows what Camelot is thinking right now...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They are probably thinking about golf.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That might be true, sadly... they sure are golf-obsessed.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They've had 
five years to make a sequel and still haven't started it! What's wrong with 
them?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Small team. Golf games. Mario sports games. Yeah, that's about it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. Well, at least Camelot wants to make a sequel.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wouldn't it be nifty if Kraden had died of old age already?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The Temple of Kraden would probably riot.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They would claim his death had been faked and he had simply left Weyard or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's so great about that rambling old fart?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who knows? He should have just fallen off Gaia Falls or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or the werewolves in Garoh could have gone insane and eaten him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... the people of Garoh are nice people... not insane and bloodthirsty.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But
don't you think Garoh would have been much more interesting if the
werewolves had been crazy and trying to turn us into werewolves too or
even just kill us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You want to be killed by a werewolf?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, I want to burn the insane werewolves.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So,
what you're saying, is that you would have liked Garoh to be a
dangerous place so you could have fun burning everything that moved?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sighs in 
disgust* I give up.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw, come on! 
It would be fun!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not listening, lalalalala~<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You suck. And have a big head.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
...................<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Fine. Be 
like that. -_- <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> THIS IS 
BORING.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. I must 
liven it up. Garet, there is something that I must tell you...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I've tried 
to hide it for so long, but I can't... <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just tell me 
already!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I LOVE YOU, GARET! *bursts into emo tears*
<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? o_O<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please tell me you feel the same way! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac! Garet 
is mine!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> OMGJENNA ;-; SAVEMEPLS *hides behind Jenna*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Step aside, Jenna! I will be the one to claim Garet's heart!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm afraid I can't allow that, Isaac.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If you're not going to step aside, then we must battle.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> With pleasure. *hands start flaming* Prepare to taste defeat, Isaac!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, guys? Can't we find a non-violent way to solve this? D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, Garet, I must do this so that I can have you to myself. *draws Sol Blade* Prepare yourself, Jenna.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Take this! *summons Meteor*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What the?! Are you walking around with Djinn on standby? Oh, and ouchies!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like having all my Djinn on standby so that I can summon. *summons Meteor again*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *falls to knees* Argh... I cannot be defeated now... I must... do this... for Garet...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That all you've got? Pathetic. I'm the only one for Garet! ♥_♥<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *unleashes Megiddo* Take that!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Darn it... all my Djinn are in recovery... I'm weakened... *collapses* ...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes! Another Megiddo and she'll be defeated and I can have Garet! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hold it!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> MIA! ;_; *glomps* SAVE ME!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What do you want, Mia? We're busy right now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, Jenna and I are currently battling for Garet's heart.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you 
can't!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What are you 
saying, Mia?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I'm pregnant with Isaac's child! And Garet's too!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bzuh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Both? How is 
that possible?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm
carrying fraternal twins, with different fathers. You see, one night, I
slept with Isaac, then Garet, on two separate occasions that were
fairly close together. During my ovulation, two eggs were released.
They both got inseminated, by sperm from separate men. It's called
heteropaternal superfecundation. Look it up.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What does he... hetero... super... what does it mean?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay,
let me explain. You and Isaac have sperm. I make eggs. I released two
eggs. Isaac's sperm fertilized one. Your sperm fertilized the other.
Make sense now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... uh, it's like, twins, but different dads, right? Like half-siblings?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That is correct.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow. That's so freaking weird.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Look on the bright side. You're the father of one of them. How does it feel?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, my parents will be pleased... but... I love Jenna. D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You must acknowledge your baby! But you don't have to live with me or anything.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whew. So it's okay for me to be with Jenna?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. All you need to do is pay child support.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Does that mean I need to get a job?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. GO GET ONE, YOU LAZY OAF!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *whimpers* Yes, ma'am...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, great. If Garet and I are the fathers of your twins... does that mean they will be traumatized by us being a couple?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, they will 
be utterly screwed up.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O_O Okay 
then...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet wants Jenna anyway, in case you didn't notice.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; ._. So... uh... twins with different fathers... is just strange.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding. I was rather surprised myself. So are you going to express joy at becoming a father or not?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, sorry. WHOOP! YAY! I'M GONNA BE A FATHER! ... Is that good enough?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I guess. Make sure you pay child support, by the way.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; I thought Garet was doing it? D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *homicidal 
glare*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep, okay, okay. ;_; Just let me get a steady job first...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're a 
slut, Mia. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why, yes, I suppose I am. Have you not even done it with Garet?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No. ._. I haven't even... done <i>it</i> yet.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's a shame. I've even had the honor of doing it with Piers. And your brother wasn't so bad either.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I knew I should have accepted that one time Saturos asked me to sleep with him. T_T<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't rush yourself, Jenna. You're still young. I just really, really enjoy sex...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please tell me you haven't done it with Ivan...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No. Not yet. But he's had practice with Hammet's concubines anyway, so he shouldn't be so bad.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* YOU GOT TO GARET FIRST? AND YOU'RE EVEN HAVING HIS BABY?! *cries* 
<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You think that's bad? I'm pregnant too!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... wut.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay,
see, Kraden made a potion but it didn't work properly and while I got
my male parts, I also kept my female parts, and somehow... when I was rubbing 
one off... stuff got where it shouldn't... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You inseminated your own egg?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. ;_; And now Kraden won't try and fix my body again until the baby is born, because he doesn't want the baby to be damaged!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That... that's not right! You can't be the mother and the father!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know it's hard to believe, but I am. 
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, Mia is pregnant with Garet's and Isaac's babies... you're pregnant with your own.... good grief... T_T<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, you think I want to have a baby with just one parent?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is too disturbed to even speak anymore*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, Jenna, you're pregnant too. Heck, <i>I'm</i> pregnant!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not pregnant, you idiot! I've never had sex!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">
 You're not very far along, but there's a mind in there... and a mind in
 me as well. Where else would these minds be coming from?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, come on! D= How could I possibly be?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do you remember that big party we had, nearly a month ago?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not much of it. We spent most of it getting wasted, didn't we?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ivan and I didn't get wasted. We're too young to drink.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So what did you two do then?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We calmly 
observed the activities of crazy drunk Adepts.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O_O
Did stuff happen then? The first thing I remember was waking up on the
floor with my panties on my head. And everyone else were passed out all
over the room.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It
seems things... got a little heated. Mia... made all the guys have an
orgy with her for one thing. Then you felt left out, started crying,
and the guys ended up playing spin the bottle rather badly to decide
who gave you pity sex.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pity sex?! And who won the game of spin the bottle?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers
did, but then you called him an old dinosaur, called him a bunch of
names, said he should go off with Kraden and he went to sit crying in a
corner.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O_O I don't remember that. He doesn't, does he?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course he doesn't. Then the guys drew straws and well, you got to do it with the guy who drew the short straw.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who was that then?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Before
I tell you, let me just say that everyone was so horribly drunk and not
thinking straight. Anyone was willing to have an orgy with Mia then
give you pity sex. <i>Anyone.</i><br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, <i>anyone</i> was willing to do me...? Out of pity?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes.
Even Felix. But remember, they were all so wasted, they could hardly
even remember their own names. You were that wasted as well.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ew. I could have done without that information... why did you feel it necessary to tell me that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, because it was Felix who drew the short straw. &gt;_&gt;'<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> PLEASE tell me they did it over again...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope, and you didn't complain either, so...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Th-then, does that... mean...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, Jenna, you had sex with Felix and are now pregnant with your brother's baby. My condolences.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!! *passes out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *pokes unconscious Jenna with a stick* Well, I'm never going to drink alcohol ever...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm never going to drink it either. The horrors we witnessed...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Truly terrible and frightening... *clings*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *clings back* WE ARE FOREVER SCARRED. ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, you said you were pregnant. Who's the father?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I think it's Alex.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> See,
this one time, I found Alex getting drunk. He didn't complain when I helped 
myself to his booze either. I really wanted to try the stuff, you know? Why do I 
have to wait until I'm older?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> One thing led 
to another, huh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. 
Honestly, it's a bit saddening... I mean, Alex? My first time ended up being 
with Alex? Gross.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Gosh... 
alcohol does some crazy stuff, doesn't it? So, what are you going to do?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When the baby's born, I'll probably just find out where he lives and leave it on his doorstep.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't do that, Sheba! What if he raises it as a megalomaniac?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then am I meant to raise it alone?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, Sheba, you won't be alone. Because... I'll help you raise the baby. Let's live together.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ivan... thank you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba... it's 
the least I can do for you...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh... head 
spinning... confused...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I missed all 
the fun. What happened? =O<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... first Isaac battled me for Garet's love...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He tried to hurt you?! That's it, I'm going to kill him...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait a minute... it was only one Megiddo, that's all! Then Mia interrupted before things got ugly...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He hit you with <b>MEGIDDO?!</b> I'm definitely going to hunt him down and...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Look, I don't mind if my dear older brother protects me, but I'd like it if you would LISTEN!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I'm listening.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia is pregnant with two babies with different fathers. Fraternal twins. The fathers are Isaac and Garet.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I didn't realize Mia got around so much...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, she does, so she's pregnant with Isaac's and Garet's babies. Piers is also pregnant.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?! No! I can't believe it... I thought he loved only me... *curls up in despair* Wait... how?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He
hasn't completely turned back into a man yet and is making sperm *and*
eggs... I don't understand it, but somehow he got himself pregnant by
inseminating his own egg...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... so, he's the mother <i>and</i> father of his own child? O_O Then he hasn't betrayed me after all... thank goodness!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are reacting rather normally to something like this... *sigh* And, also, Sheba is pregnant too by the look of things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How did that happen? D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba and 
Alex got drunk and did stuff with each other apparently.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is a lot to take in...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The worst is yet to come... Felix. Please prepare yourself.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am also 
pregnant. <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> <font size="6"><b><i>WHAT THE HELL?!</i></b></font>
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please don't use big font like that. It's frightening.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who is the 
father, Jenna?! I am going to drag them down here and beat the
living shit out of them, then make them promise to live with you for as
long as you have a child!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do
you remember that party when everyone got so drunk, they had no idea
who they were or what they were doing, me included? Ivan and Sheba know
everything that happened at that party... and... well... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So that was when some slimeball got you pregnant?! They are going to pay for this! You know who it is, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, Sheba wouldn't lie about something like this... so... sorry to say, but you're the father. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh...wha... <font size="8"><b><i>WHAT?!</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I
saw it with my very own eyes. You drew the short straw when the guys
were trying to decide who should give Jenna pity sex, because Mia just
had an orgy and she was feeling left out. So you and Jenna started
getting it on like animals. It seemed like you enjoyed it too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <i>Noooooo!</i><br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. I am pregnant with your child. Proceed to beat the shit out of yourself now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This can't be! But... what are we going to tell our parents?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, we'll just tell them the truth. If they don't like it, tough shit.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The baby could be deformed! ._. What if it doesn't even look human?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then we sell it to a freak show and get on with our lives.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How can you be so casual about this?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Would you rather I stabbed my eyes out or something?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No... but... this is just too crazy!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> In a few months, there will be five babies, one of them from a hermaphrodite. Now that's crazy.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> People have got to use protection!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It seems 
protection is out of the question when we're drunk. It was definitely an unintended accident with Piers.
Mia... I'm sure she behaved quite irresponsibly.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But what are we going to do? Should we live and raise the baby together?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was hoping to live with Garet though...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right... well, at least you'll have support then. But won't Garet be helping Mia?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... Mia wants both Isaac and Garet to pay her child support...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then who will pay for our child?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess you'll have to. It is your child after all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just hope Piers doesn't ask me to raise his child with him then... this is so complicated. T_T<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers deserves to be alone, for being an idiot and killing kittens.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What do you mean? D= I've only ever killed a Djinni 
by accident. I never killed a kitten.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When you fap, Iris kills a kitten.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I had no idea. The poor kitten...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers, why 
were you fapping? Am I not good enough for you? D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, Felix, you are so very, <i>very</i> 
good ^_^ I just wanted to try my new body out.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> TOO MUCH INFORMATION &gt;O<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I kind of like being a hermaphrodite... there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, Piers! You must turn back into a man eventually! ._.;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I can't, not until after this thing inside me is born.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You'll 
probably have to stay a woman a bit longer than that, though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heck, no! I'm gonna turn back into a man immediately!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But you'll have to breastfeed your own baby, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My brain just broke. D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> HECK NO! I ain't breastfeeding! *sobs* I want to be a man again...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want you to be a man again too! *hugs*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; *hugs back*<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have a super fun activity now 
for us to do now! Since us three girls... and Piers... are pregnant, let's think of some names for our babies!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm going to name my baby Alex, whatever gender. Just because.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, why? Alex doesn't deserve to be acknowledged!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is the father of my baby, like it or not, and I think if it was a girl, naming it Alex would be hilarious.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Right. Does Alex know about it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I haven't seen him since, and 
he was drunk so probably not...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That 
disgusting lolicon...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Who are you calling a 
loli?!<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Uh, er... so 
what are your plans for the future?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm
going to raise my child to hate him, but without knowing he's the
father, and one day, there will be an epic battle between the two as my
child saves the world from his evil grasp.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *blinks* 0_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And,
since Ivan is going to help me raise the baby, the baby will think of
Ivan as its father, and if Alex kills Ivan or something, then the epic
battle will probably go like this:<br><br>"You killed my father!"<br><br>"No, Alex. <i>I</i> am your father."<br><br>"That can't be!"<br><br>"Search your heart. You know it to be true."<br><br>"Nooooooooo!"<br>
<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, are you on something?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? I thought it would be cool!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, don't name the child Alex. It would be confusing.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe if I combined our names. Like Aleba or Shebex. What do you think?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, forget it... YOU SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE CHILDREN.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're mean! *runs away crying*<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, anyone else?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I kind of want to name my child Freak. =D<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, Jenna, shouldn't we discuss proper names first?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I like the name Freak for it...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why would you give your baby a hurtful name like Freak?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's the child of a brother and sister. It's a freak.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm pretty sure it's still a human being...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, sure, just you wait until it pops out and you'll see it has cloven feet and two heads or something!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is not going to have cloven feet and two heads!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course it will, or it will just look fugly and barely even human...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can't you at least just think up a proper name?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We could call the kid Incest! =O<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... I was 
thinking along the lines of<i> actual </i>names...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, have you got anything in mind?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nothing yet, but I can think up something better than Freak or Incest...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I WANNA NAME IT INCEST!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We can't call it Incest!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We are, and that's final!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Fine... go ahead. Don't blame me if it has mental issues.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It will have mental issues anyway. Hey, Mia, where did you go?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, sorry, I fell asleep during your tiresome argument...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix and I are gonna name the child Incest!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... that's... fantastic.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Got any names for your babies?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Since it's twins, I think I'll give them rhyming names for the fun of it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sounds cheesy, but okay...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe Chad and Brad, if they are boys... or Jane and Paine if they are girls... what do you think?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> =/ Maybe you should have Garet and Isaac name the babies...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh, I guess rhyming is too cheesy... Garet? Isaac? Any ideas?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Name mine Garet Jr.!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But what if it's a girl?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then... um, name it Greta. That's the letters of my name rearranged to a girl's name. Weird, huh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can live 
with that... Isaac?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What about Ami if it's a girl, or Ike if it's a guy?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So you're suggesting a rearranging of my name or a diminutive of yours?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yep. Cool, huh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not bad. So, Piers, what are you going to name your child?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Since Jenna's not naming her kid Freak, I'm naming mine Freak. Or dumping it on a doorstep and running away. Not sure yet.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers, you must accept responsibility for your baby!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't want to! I want to become a man again, not be breastfeeding the freak for months!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I just hope you change your mind later...<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *silently comes in and sets off bombs*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What happen?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Somebody set up us the bomb!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We get signal!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Main screen turn on.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's you!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How are you gentlemen! Oh, and ladies too. All your 
base are belong to us. You are on the way to destruction. <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What you 
say!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You have no chance to survive. Make your time. Ha ha ha.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Captain!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Take off every 'Zig'! You know what you doing. Move 'Zig' for great justice.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are we 
speaking with bad grammar anyway?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No idea.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, Alex! Don't you know you're about to become a father?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Acknowledge your unborn child, YOU EVIL BASTARD!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh oh. It 
couldn't be... that time I got drunk... and Sheba was there...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's right! 
You dirty lolicon trash!<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> I'm not a loli!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Th-then... 
you're...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Damn straight! Sheba is pregnant with your baby, you asshole!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nooooooooo! *warps out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh? Where did he go?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't think he's coming back...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He rejected his own child. What a jerk...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's alright, Sheba. I'll definitely be here for you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> SEX!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh great. Kraden's here too. T_T<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> WHAT
WAS THAT? You must respect your elders and treat them with respect, not
express disappointment at their mere presence. Back in my day, young
whelps listened dutifully to their elders and most certainly did not
act so rudely around them. You should learn from them, Garet. RESPECT
ME! Or else I shall have to tell your parents-<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do you ever 
shut up, you rambling old fart?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My
goodness, Isaac! Since when did you ask me to stop speaking so abruptly
and then go so far as to insinuate I am an old fart who likes to ramble
on and on? It is most rude indeed and I am appalled at such rude
behavior!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> STOP TALKING SO MUCH!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why
does everyone hate it so much when I am speaking? I just enjoy speaking
so much and once I start talking, I am afraid that I find it near
impossible to stop, so you will simply have to put up with my rambling,
see?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh. You are hopeless!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna! I want to have sex! Can we sleep together?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> <font size="5"><i><b>Hell, NO!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> </b></i></font>Aww, pleeeaaaase?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stay away from my sister, you dirty old creep!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs* I 
guess I'll just have to buy some dirty magazines...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ew. EW. Please keep such things to yourself!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But you 
told everyone how you got pregnant...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's
different! I had to explain how I even got pregnant in the first
place... and anyway, nobody wants to know about you because you're old
and gross!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I may be 
old and gross... but this doesn't look old and gross, does it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *chokes on foam in mouth and goes into coma*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *faints from trauma*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *looks for something to gouge out eyes with* 
<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> EEK! *blushes and faints in horror*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh. UGH. *runs out of room and throws up everywhere*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> PUT IT AWAY!!! *covers eyes*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *passes out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh, you're 
in better shape than King Hydros.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? How did you even get to see Hydros like that?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> In
Lemuria, the people often take public baths together. And yes, I've even been
in the same bath as King Hydros. It was quite an honor.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess that's why you didn't freak 
out...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, um... wanna have sex with me?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> NO!
Anyway, it's your fault I was a woman and am now a hermaphrodite and
PREGNANT! You are the last person I would do it with right now!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm still working on that potion to turn you into a man... but I am working on some other cool potions too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm almost afraid to ask... what do they do?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well,
there's this transforming potion. All I have to do is take someone's
hair, put it in some of the potion and drink, then I temporarily take
on the form of that person.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're not planning to use it for evil things, are you? o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> &gt;=D Why, of course I am. In fact, I'm going to test it right now, with some of Garet's hair right here!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Everyone! KRADEN I- ... *thud*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *puts away brick* Nice try. Now to find Garet and knock him out. Oh, Garet~!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_o Ulp... you called, Kraden?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Here, smell this nice chloroform *presses against Garet's face*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-wha... oooh... *thud*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Muahahaha!
*ties Garet up and puts him in closet* With Garet out of the way, this
shall be a breeze! *drinks potion and transforms into Garet*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, Jenna?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, Garet? What is it now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just wanted to say... you are looking exceptionally beautiful today.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. *blushes* Um... of course I am. A girl's got to look her best. ^____^;<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I also got you some flowers as a gift. Here.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh... daisies? ... You shouldn't have! o_0<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sorry. I can't afford much right now, and I really wanted to give you something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, it's okay. It's the thought that counts after all. You are so sweet, Garet... thank you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna... I love you...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I... I love you too!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then shall we have our first kiss now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay. *closes eyes and waits*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *leans in and is about to kiss*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hold it right there!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Felix! What do you think you are doing, interrupting a romantic moment?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah! I was just about to kiss her!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't let you do that.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix? 
What's wrong with you? D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> First you 
get her pregnant, then you interfere with her relationships? You really are a 
siscon, aren't you?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't think Jenna wants a relationship with you. 
And I'm not a siscon!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I love Garet! D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, well, Garet's not the person standing next to you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-what?! *stares at Garet* Of course he is!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah! I am Garet, you idiot. Who else would I be? His evil twin?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or maybe you are Kraden!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *shrieks* What?! How?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Remember Kraden makes potions? He obviously made a transformation one!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Curse you, Felix! *shakes a fist*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ._. But why did you think it's not Garet?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I found the real Garet unconscious in a closet just now!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Damn... I thought I locked it! CURSE YOU!!! *runs off*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ew. ._. I nearly kissed Kraden. *shudders*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden is a freak. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I knew we should have just pushed him off Gaia Falls...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's just wait and hope he dies of old age...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't think he might try drinking some of Lemuria's draught?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I sure hope he doesn't... ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, we 
could just tell the Lemurians not to give him any, I guess...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I WANT A HUG! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw, what's wrong, Fe?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniff*
I'm emo, my sister is pregnant with our baby after a drunken night and
my thousands of years old boyfriend is a PREGNANT HERMAPHRODITE! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, I'm trying to turn myself back into a man. ._. And... I'm not thousands of years old!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then, how old are you, Piers? How old?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sorry. Not telling.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs* How can you treat me like this, after I got my sister pregnant? Do you want me to kill myself?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Here, have a cookie. *hands a cookie over*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *eats cookie* ^_____^<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, are you feeling better now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *nods happily* Much better. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good. Now why don't we go to the bedroom and test my dual equipment again? ^_- I assure you it's fun.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> R-really? I don't know... doing a pregnant hermaphrodite is a bit...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, come on, Felix! Don't be so silly! *starts dragging off to bedroom* ^_____^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep. Someone help me? ;_; *is dragged off to Piers's bedroom*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're gonna have LOTS of fun. ^_^ *drags into bedroom and shuts door*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I must be the only person in the world to screw a pregnant hermaphrodite and my own sister...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. 
You're special! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Cursed is more like it...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nonsense. ^_^ Time for sex~!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nobody likes me. ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, you're a damn old fart. Ugh. I hated traveling with you. You're the reason I abandoned everyone on Idejima.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, really? ._. So, why are you here?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm hoping to see Mia and ask her to marry me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't you need to be in a relationship first?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If I have Isaac hostage, she will have no choice!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You have 
Isaac hostage?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, not yet. Still trying to figure out a way to kidnap him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Gosh, aren't you an ambitious young man, Alex? It warms the cockles of my heart indeed.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am calmly resisting the urge to rip out said heart and stomp on it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You know, Alex, I am a lonely old man to tell the truth. All I want is some sex and nobody will do it with me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Perhaps you're trying too low on the age scale?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I don't want to do it with old people! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then end your suffering by killing yourself. It works. Trust me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> PLEASE HAVE SEX WITH ME!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No. I am straight. I love Mia.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs* NOBODY LOVES ME!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So you have finally realised it, you pathetic old man.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> SEX!!! *goes crazy* I WANT SEX!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If you're really that desperate, go find a freaking whorehouse or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then can I borrow some money?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There. Now get out of my sight, you idiot.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay! I'M COMING, WHORES! *runs off*<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* That pathetic old man is absolutely sickening...<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> YO. THIS IS YOUR LOCAL FRIENDLY ZOMBIE PASSING THROUGH.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ack! Babi?! I thought you were dead!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, yeah. I'm a ZOMBIE. Duh.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What the heck?! How did you come back as a zombie?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hello there, Isaac. Did you ever get that draught?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, no. We had more important things to do, dumbass. Now get back to being dead!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then I must get REVENGE! I shall feast on your BRAINS! MUAHAHAHAHA!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah! It's 
Babi! O_O<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hello there, Sheba, my long time hostage. How are you doing?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> GAH! SAVE ME, SOMEONE! *runs away*<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait! Come baaaaaack! D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, this is a surprise indeed.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You! You're-!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess I didn't kill you properly or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You killed him, Alex? Why?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because
I heard of his desire to be immortal or whatever and to find out more
about Alchemy. I feared he would be a potential rival to claiming what
I wanted.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You cannot defeat me! I am a ZOMBIE and will eat your BRAAAAAIIIIINNNS!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> =O Babi!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah, Kraden. Guess what! I'm a ZOMBIE!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Awesome! 
And I just got kicked out of a whorehouse!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh, I can't 
even get any either, because nobody wants to commit necrophilia.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow, I 
don't know which of us has it worse?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I seriously 
do not want to listen to old men whining about how they can't get some. *decapitates Babi*<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is a dead 
zombie*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> NOOOOOOOOOO! BAAAAABIIIIII!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Damn, you really are pathetic. How did you get kicked out of that whorehouse? I gave you money!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Apparently, even whores prefer image over money sometimes!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? o_o I thought they only wanted the money. How surprising.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs* When am I ever going to get some?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No freaking clue. *leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; Seeeeeex!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden, NOBODY is going to give you sex. Now STFU.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whyyyyy?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because you're a pathetic rambling old man!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The main problem seems to be that I am old!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, Kraden. It's because you're past it. You're gross and stuff.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are all AGEIST!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They aren't ageist. They just have particular sexual preferences, that do not include you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is there no way to get someone to have sex with me?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> NO. Now get out of here before I set you on fire!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs* NOBODY LOVES ME!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please do us all a favor and kill yourself.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But can I at least have some sex before I kill myself?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> None of us are that nice, Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Fine! If that's what you all want, I shall go and kill myself then! Happy?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, very. And then we'll all sing "Ding, Dong, the Wicked Witch is Dead."<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ... *stomps off* YOU ALL SUCK! EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> HEY GUYS? D= MY HEAD CAME LOOSE AND NOW ALL I SEE IS A WALL.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ack! It's still alive?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess killing the undead is harder than it looks.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't die! Muahahahahaha! I am IMMORTAL now, suckers!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You may be immortal now, but I imagine you can't do much with your head cut off.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll show you, you whelp! I'll... I'll... roll over and bite you! *tries to roll* Aw. I can't.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm gonna go get a bone crusher. Be back later.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, you might want to try taking his body and putting it in an incinerator too. Make him properly dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good idea. *drags body away*<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey you!!! Where do you think you are taking my body?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *gasp* Babi! You can still speak! Oh thank goodness! *picks up head and hugs it*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> D= I WANT TO UNSEE IT.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So do I. ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, put me down! I'm not a cuddly toy!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll find a 
way to get your head back on your body... wait, where's your body?<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That guy took 
it. When I get my body back, I'm eating his brains first!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> First? Who 
else's brains are you planning on eating?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Everyone's! 
Muahahahahahaha!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are you 
all being so horrible to Babi?! The lot of you should be ashamed of yourselves!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's a 
kidnapper, he's undead, and he wants to eat our brains. That's not a good enough 
reason?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You just 
don't understand him like I do! Hmph! *walks off with Babi*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden is such a freak... ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, what's 
with him being a total nymphomaniac all of a sudden?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think he needs to go to some mental clinic for sex obsession.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or we could put him in an old people's home, claiming he's senile. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm back. Babi's body was disposed of and I brought a crusher for the head. Where is it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, Kraden 
got upset and went off with him just now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why didn't 
you stop him?! Now I have to go hunt him down and deal with Babi once and for 
all. Good grief. *warps out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> For once, I 
don't totally disagree with Alex's actions.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, Alex is 
definitely the lesser of two evils in this case.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's 
definitely better looking too...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uhh... okay, 
Jenna...<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> What?! Just 
because he's an asshole doesn't mean I can't admit he's handsome!<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Let's not pursue this 
subject, please...<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
*warps back in* I can now safely say Lord Babi of Tolbi is no more. That's one 
evil asshole gone from the face of Weyard.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> I can think of another 
evil asshole who should be removed from the face of Weyard...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> ...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey,
since everyone is pregnant, I made a special potion that makes babies
grow many times faster! They will pop out of you immediately!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really?! Is it safe?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh,
absolutely. I tested it on Kushinada. She now has a beautiful baby boy
named Takeru. The only drawback seems to be that he won't stop growing
so quickly.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, so long as it means our children leave home quicker, it's fine! But was the mother fine?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly. 
She felt quite sore afterwards but otherwise she was fine.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> JUST GIVE US THE POTION!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Calm down, Piers. Okay, one at a time, and somebody should have sheets ready. Are you all planning on a group birthing?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just want the damn thing out. I don't care who's watching.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I feel the same.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So do I. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't mind being pregnant, but taking that potion sounds like less hassle.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why do I detect a distinct hatred of babies in this room? Or is it something else?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just give them the potion, Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheesh.
The youth of today are so impatient. I would just like to remind the
ladies. USE PROTECTION. Piers... hold off masturbation until you're a
man again, okay?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, absolutely. T_T;<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Very well. *hands everyone the potions* Now drink, go lie down on them sheets over there and scream in agony as you give birth!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll go first. *drinks potion and immediately collapses* HOLY CRAP! ALREADY?! OWWWW!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good grief, Kraden! You could have made the potion work a little slower! *helps Mia to sheets*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, she should have drank it when she was already lying down!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; *is painfully giving birth and screaming*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Calm down, Mia! It's alright! Isaac and I are here!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's your fault I'm like this! YOU BASTARDS!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sorry. I'll wear a condom next time.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Me too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What was 
that?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *winces* Uh, er, nothing, Jenna. Honest.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! *promptly spits out two babies*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well done, Mia! Which one's mine?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This one must be mine. It's got really red hair.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then the blue-haired one must be mine. It's a girl!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My one's a boy!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can. You. Stop. Fawning. Over. The. Babies. And. PAY ATTENTION TO ME!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is it, 
Mia?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet, you can call the baby Garet Jr. Isaac, you can call the girl Ami. Now someone get me to a hot bath, then I want to rest!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Come on then, Mia. Ivan, will you help Garet watch the babies and don't let him pick them up!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What, you think I'll drop them or something?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet, everybody thinks you'll drop the babies. Aren't they cute though?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's my turn! *sits down on clean sheets and drinks* Oog... it feels like I'm having the runs...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... you must have an impressively high pain threshold...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is nothing! It feels no worse than monthly cramps!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't want to watch... I'm scared to think 
about what's coming out...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're the one who put this thing in me! You are watching this to the bloody end!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am never going to drink alcohol again...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Me neither! Oh... ooh... ouch! *gives birth*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> <i>Ouch?!</i><br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It didn't hurt very much! *peeks between legs* Oh...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well? Does it look human?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *holds
up a very ugly looking baby with red eyes, little horns, cloven hooves
and a forked tail. It also has two mouths and slits for a nose* Not
really. <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good grief... O_O Uh... who do you think it looks like more?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It doesn't even look human. Ew. Uh... so, we're
definitely calling it Incest, then.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do we have to keep it? Wait, what gender is it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *looks
closely between the legs* Um... I don't think it even HAS a gender.
Look, it doesn't even have anything between the legs! There's only a
butthole!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It really is a freak of nature... so what do you want to do with Incest?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> First, I'm going to wash and have a nice long rest, while you look after Incest. Then we'll decide what to do with it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're going to leave me alone with this freaky thing?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. Have fun. *leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; *is left alone with freak and looks curiously at it* How does it pee anyway? 
*Incest suddenly pees out of ears* OH GROSS!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can I study it? =D<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'd love to give it to you, but I'll have to wait and see what Jenna says...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay. I'm sure there's a lab in Tolbi somewhere that would love to study this freak of nature too...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Enough chattering! *drinks the potion and sits on sheets* ... <font size="8"><i><b>AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> </b></i></font>Sheba! *rushes to side* It's okay, hold on! You can do it! Hey, it's crowning now! Keep pushing!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *has baby 
after a lot more screaming, then passes out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't believe it. She freaking passed out... *picks up baby*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ivan! Get back over here and help! This baby's making noise!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh, okay, okay. *walks back over with Sheba's baby* It's a boy, if anyone cares.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is still passed out on floor* x_x<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not so sure about this... *drinks potion and sits down* I'm scared...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's okay! *puts Incest on floor and runs over to hold Piers's hand* I'm here for you!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Did you just put that thing on the floor? You are all so irresponsible!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It really hurts, Fe! ;-; OMIGOSHTHEPAINIHATEITMAKEITGOAWAY!!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *holds Piers's hand tightly* You'll be alright, Piers!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> AAAAAH! *gives birth* Whew... it's over... that was disturbing indeed...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, look at that. The baby looks just like you. But... it seems to be both genders...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really?!
O_O Let me see! ... Indeed, that's large enough to be... but I think
there's a girl part there... good grief. It's a hermaphrodite.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> At least you didn't have a genderless freak of nature...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A hermaphrodite is pretty freaking weird though... anyway... I'll call it... Freak!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh... *wakes up* My baby! Where's my baby?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, Sheba, you're awake! Here, a healthy baby boy. It luckily looks like you and not Alex...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Great. I'm going to call it Shebex after me and Alex! I don't care what anyone thinks!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why do you hate the baby so much?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I never asked for it!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Muahahahaha! *kidnaps Shebex* I shall take my son and raise him to be evil!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... No. Stop. Please don't take Shebex. By the way, I'm being sarcastic. Do whatever you want.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba! What are you doing?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is the father. He can have him if he likes!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I certainly will. Farewell. *disappears with Shebex*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whew. I guess I don't have to spend my teenage years raising a child then. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would have raised it with you, you know...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes,
Ivan, I appreciate the thought but we're both a little young for
raising children. Let's just enjoy our freedom while we still have it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">
 Right, let 
me try and get my head around all this crap... Mia has had mine and 
Garet's children. I am the father of a girl named Ami, Garet is father 
to a boy named Garet Jr. Sheba had a boy, Shebex, but Alex kidnapped 
him. The other two... uh... the less said, the better.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? You 
don't want everyone to know Felix and I had a sexless baby with
two mouths, slits for a nose, red eyes, cloved hooves, horns and a tail,
that pees out of its ears and is called Incest?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do you really want to spread that around, Jenna?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, to be honest... I guess not. It is kinda weird, isn't it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Have your parents seen Incest yet?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. They broke down crying the moment they saw Incest...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That will teach you not to get drunk and be laid by your own brother.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, it's not like we did it on purpose, you know! ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, uh, what are you going to do with Incest?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix and I have agreed to give it to Kraden, so he's going to look at it then take it to Tolbi to be studied at a lab.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You would have your child grow up in a lab?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That thing isn't going to be able to grow up in a human society! It will be bullied or murdered for looking so inhuman!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course, you're right. A lab would be a much safer environment for little Incest. So, uh, it really doesn't have a 
sex?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope, none. It's absolutely 
devoid of equipment. I wonder how it manages to pee out of its ears... it's messy too. Ew.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That thing is just damn weird...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! Acknowledge my hermaphrodite baby! What has Freak ever done to you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's a hermaphrodite. It's called Freak. What the heck?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think it happened because I am a hermaphrodite at the moment. Can't wait to be a man again...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, you're keeping Freak, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess I will. It's not Freak's fault it only has one parent and is a hermaphrodite.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Freak sure looks a lot like you... o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess when one person makes a baby with themselves, they get a clone or something... yeah, Freak's my clone...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, uh, I hope Freak is able to live a long and healthy life...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It might be a bit screwed up mentally and physically, but I'm sure it will be fine.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good luck... o_o I sure don't expect that other freak, Incest, to last long...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't either, but those labs will probably do all they can to keep it alive.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I
bet they will have a special freak show and people will come, paying to
see the freaky inhuman thing, The Freak Called Incest. Or whatever.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sounds cool enough. I don't want to see it again though. It creeps me out...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Everyone is creeped out by that thing. You're not alone.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How could we have brought something like that into this world...?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You see, incest is not the best after all...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That isn't funny, Isaac. You know we were so drunk, we were just completely out of our minds.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just try not to have sex with him again, Jenna.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> As if I would! ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> LOOK! I'M NAKED!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Everyone seems to be pointedly ignoring you, Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed,
they are. It is a crying shame. I am hoping someone will look upon my
naked body and get the irrepressible urge to have sex with me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think you need to be treated for delusional fantasies and of course, your sex addiction.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I like sex a lot!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, Kraden, I am well aware of that...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, what can I do for you, Alex?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you see, I kidnapped my baby son who is also Sheba's.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah, of course. Shebex, right? What an unfortunate name.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know. It is a disgusting name indeed. But I'm too lazy to change it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. Well, Sheba hasn't been missing Shebex or anything. In fact, I think she's forgotten she's ever had a baby.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* How carefree the mother of my child is... it does make things easier though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's strange you kidnapped your son. I never thought of you as the fatherly type.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't get me wrong. I just like the idea of having a prodigy to raise in my image.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right. I just hope he doesn't end up 
robbing cradles. Not even I would go that low!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, now, we 
were both drunk and out of our minds.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That is no 
excuse! You are a lowlife to do it with a fourteen year old!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Enough of this. Have you got a potion to turn people evil?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? What would you want that for?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To make it easier to turn Shebex evil...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No. I would never make such a thing!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Curses. Looks like I will just have to try my hardest to raise Shebex as evil.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, sure. Good luck with that then...<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mwehehehehe... *disappears*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *shakes head* What a freaking weirdo...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Was that Alex just now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. He wanted an evil potion for the baby. I don't make those though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I see. Alex is such a nice guy, you know...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-what?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Taking my burden away like that, without demanding anything... sometimes he can be a nice person.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I thought it was a <i>kidnap</i>?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kidnap, schmidnap. Thanks to him, I can freely enjoy my teenage years the way I want to.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... I see. You don't miss Shebex or anything?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope. I'm happy knowing his father is giving him all the care he needs.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It doesn't even bother you knowing Alex is trying to raise Shebex as an evil person?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope. Should it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, forget it. The baby would probably turn out evil anyway with a name like Shebex!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I thought it was a perfectly fine name! ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It isn't. Trust me on this.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh, I don't care anyway.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Such an irresponsible mother...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, Sheba?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">
 I want to be a man again as soon as possible. You don't have Shebex 
anymore. Since you're lactating, could you breastfeed Freak?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are asking me to be a wet nurse and loan my breasts to that <i>hermaphrodite?!</i><br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, please?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hell, NO, 
you moron! *stomps away* <br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs*
I just want to be a man again! I don't want to spend a year as a
hermaphrodite, feeding a baby with boobs I shouldn't even have!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's the matter, Piers?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want to find a wet nurse to feed Freak, so that Kraden will let me be a man again! ;_; Sheba said no!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh... well... I know! I'll ask Jenna! She's giving Incest away to the labs in Tolbi after all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; OMG, 
really? <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course. I want you to be a man again too. Jenna! Will you be a wet nurse for Piers?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please?
Piers can't become a man for a year otherwise and I want him to be a
man again, he also wants the same. He needs someone to breastfeed
Freak...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> PLEEEEAAAAAASE?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh,
fine. It sounds more convenient than having a soggy shirt all the time
anyway. Sheba doesn't know what she's sentenced herself to.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> YAY! THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU! *glomps*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thank goodness. Kraden! Jenna will feed Freak, so turn Piers back into a man now!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw. Seeing Piers with boobies is kind of funny...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What did you say, old man? *raises a glowing fist*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep. Here's the potion! *hands it over*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thank you. *drinks the potion and is instantly turned back into a man*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It looks like you're back to normal. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. This calls for a celebration, wouldn't you say? ^_-<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You mean... THAT?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, I mean THAT. ^_^ *drags Felix to bedroom*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Is it just me or is Piers a bit crazy about having sex with Felix?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, it seems that way. Would you like to have sex with me, Jenna?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> NO, you dirty old man! *casts Dragon Fume*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is 
barbecued and smoking*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What a 
loser...<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You can say 
that again.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex? Why 
are you here again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was wondering if Sheba would breastfeed Shebex or if I should try making some formula instead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Honestly, Alex? Sheba does not have a shred of maternal instinct inside herself. She won't do it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She won't even breastfeed her own baby?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure she's completely forgotten she ever had one in the first place.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. Jeez. What kind of a mother is she?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The
worst kind, obviously. At least I have a reason to shun my child. It
doesn't even look human. Shebex on the other hand is quite normal
looking.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now I feel sorry for Shebex, having a mother like that... well, I'll just give him formula then.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If
you're really trying to raise him evil, don't be too friendly with him,
ok? I think that creates bad children and gives them psychological
issues. The lack of a mother helps too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course. Thanks for the tips, Jenna. I shall leave now. *warps out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now why did I just tell a bad guy how to raise an evil child? o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You like the idea of Alex screwing with an innocent child's mind?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm,
yeah, that's probably it. I'm interested to see how much Alex can
really fuck up his child's mind. It would be quite amusing too if
everything failed and the kid ends up hugging kittens and giving
orphans ice cream.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heh, yeah. Now I want to see what happens too!</p>
