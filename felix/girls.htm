<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> In the process 
of adding more random stuff to the Valley...<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're 
apparently going to be saying stuff about each other.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> First is our 
thoughts on the guys!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's start 
with Isaac.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac is 
very heroic and brave.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That scarf 
is cool.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's also 
quite cute and good-looking to me too.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Man... Isaac 
and that scarf. He's so attached to it.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did his mom 
make it?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think so. 
Isaac's been wearing it since we were children.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He must have 
tripped over it a lot when he was little.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Funny 
to imagine a child wearing a scarf that long.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac has 
flaws. There, I said it.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? No! 
Isaac is absolutely perfect! He has no flaws!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He has a bad 
habit of blindly following orders.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He kind of 
sounds annoying when he speaks.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, when 
he talked, he had a kind of arrogant edge to him and sounded full of himself.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not very 
polite either. Telling Agatio and Karst to get out of the way just like that...<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He probably 
was just a bit panicked. Garet was hanging by one arm.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac is sweet 
and kind and heroic and a strong, brave, warrior with an awesome scarf! He is 
the best!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He didn't 
seem that upset on Mars Lighthouse either.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. We 
hadn't seen our parents in three years and we'd thought them dead for most of 
that time. But Isaac didn't even grieve.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think he's 
a robot.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't we 
just move on and talk about someone else now?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> GARET!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Annoying, a 
goofball, loud, brash and impolite. What do you see in him?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If you can 
overlook Garet's bad habits, he's not so bad.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How can you 
say such things, Sheba? Garet is sweet, adorable and funny!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is funny 
sometimes.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He even 
jumped for you on Jupiter Lighthouse.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... It was 
just unfortunate he ended up in danger.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whenever he 
scratches his butt, it grosses me out.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? I 
never see it. Though he does have a loud snore.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh, no 
kidding. And he eats all the food.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet has a 
never ending stomach.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's a pig.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But despite 
all that, I can see his good qualities. He's perfect boyfriend material.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Your idea of 
perfect is bizarre, Jenna.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So is yours, 
Mia.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess we 
simply have differing opinions.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It seems that 
way. We should accept our differences and move on.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now we shall 
talk about Ivan!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's so 
short.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. I often 
worry I'm going to step on him.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's just so 
miniscule, we need a magnifying glass to see him.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Your short 
jokes are unfunny.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's a cutie 
though.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know! He's 
the kind of person I would want to drag home and keep as a pet!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A pet?!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Me too. I'd 
pinch his cheeks all day long...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's just so 
cute, sweet and adorable...<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You two are 
scary.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's hard to 
take him seriously at times because he's so short and stuff.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But when 
you're about to be on the receiving end of a Spark Plasma, you really have no 
choice.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think Ivan 
is cute too... but in a different way to what you two are getting at.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If he was a 
little older, we might consider him in that way.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But he's 
really just like a cute little brother.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ivan is cute 
and a little shy but loyal and likes to stick around. I think he's the ideal 
match for me.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
think we've said all we can on the blond midget.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's a good 
reason why he has so many fans!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> FBM shall 
always prevail!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Fans of the 
Blonde Midget, right?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Shouldn't it 
be Blond?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They spell 
it Blonde on the fanlisting site.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
think it matters that much.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh... now 
let's talk about Felix.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's 
awesome! He jumped all the way off a lighthouse to save me!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My brother 
is rash, suicidal and a moron. -_-<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Well, he 
does seem rash and suicidal, but he's not a moron.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course 
not. I just like getting away with calling him names.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Where are 
you getting this suicidal thing from? I don't see it.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, he tried 
to pick a fight with Saturos and Menardi on the Venus Lighthouse.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was to 
protect me though.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But a Level 
5 Venus Adept without any Djinn isn't going to last long against two powerful 
Mars Adepts.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding. He 
would have been flattened in seconds if we hadn't turned up in time.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* But 
things turned out for the best, didn't they?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish we 
could do something about his emoness. It's scary.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. We have 
to keep most sharp objects out of reach, but we can't do anything about his 
sword.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor Felix 
has had it rough.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He keeps 
getting into a lot of bad luck as well. Like falling into the river with the 
boulder falling...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Almost getting 
his butt kicked by Saturos and Menardi, then jumping off a lighthouse on 
purpose...<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then there 
was the tidal wave that hit us.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And Agatio 
and Karst tried to kill Felix and Piers on Jupiter Lighthouse. Luckily, Sheba 
and I turned up to help.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No wonder he's 
emo...<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He sure is 
good-looking though and that ponytail rocks.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like his 
cape. What colour is it again?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It changes 
colour.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I swear I'll 
never understand that... it went from green to blue.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's talk 
about Picard now!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pow Pow 
Picard!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Picard is 
quite hot.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those yellow 
eyes are just odd though.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Maybe 
he's part cat or something.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That would 
be pretty strange... how is that possible?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those 
muscles of his are impressive.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh yes, 
certainly. He has such large muscles!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He must work 
out at the gym a lot.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe if they 
have a gym in Lemuria and he's been going there for his whole life...<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, 
possibly being a hundred or more, I suppose that would explain the giant 
muscles.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We should tell 
him to take it easy.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. No 
spinach for him either.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ew, spinach. 
Who even likes that stuff?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Still, Picard 
is pretty popular. The OBHL was quite large back in the day.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's silly 
how they all refuse to call him Piers though. The game's been out for at least 
four years!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are we 
calling him Picard then?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To be 
consistent with the rest of the site. Can't be bothered to change Picard to 
Piers everywhere.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The 
webmistress called him Picard for a long time.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see... now 
who do we talk about?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, Alex, I 
guess.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *hiss* I hate 
him. He's an evil jerk.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He was 
always kind of annoying and full of himself.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, he was 
just so self absorbed. It was annoying.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He betrayed my 
clan and didn't even apologise afterwards!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And he kept 
calling me dear!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He insulted 
us in Champa!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He also tried 
to steal Alchemy!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex also 
had the nerve to call me insensitive!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And used 
Agatio and Karst to threaten us to light the lighthouse quicker!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Plus he 
tried to steal Picard's ship.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Clearly, he is 
rotten to the core.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Are 
there any good things to say about him?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't 
think of anything.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Neither can I.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Even his 
childhood friend hasn't got anything good to say about him?!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We were never 
friends. I knew he was evil from the start.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *reads Mia's 
mind* You're lying.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who said you 
could read my mind?!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whoah, whoah, 
time out. Now let's talk about... um...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> SATUROS!!!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're 
invading your page.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're 
girls too, so it's perfectly alright.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heh... er... 
we have... no complaints.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Go... right 
ahead.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Y-yeah, do 
whatever you want.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos... 
he's got some sort of smouldering sexiness about him.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hands off, 
he's too old for you. Plus, he's mine.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're 
pretty possessive.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A woman 
must learn to hold onto her man! He must not be allowed to get away!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I should be 
more like you, sis...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But not to 
Saturos. I shall never allow anybody else to get my Satty.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I 
understand. Saturos is a great and strong warrior. It's sad he had to be 
defeated.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. 
But we died nobly for our hometown!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish I 
could have seen the Fusion Dragon.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* 
Saturos is so hot and sexy...<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Shall we 
talk about Agatio now?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is 
certainly not as good-looking as my Saturos.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *exaggerated 
sigh* Agatio's a good warrior, but unfortunately he's a little lacking in 
brains.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When the 
odds are stacking up against you, it is important to keep fighting! Learn from 
Agatio!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But, sis...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Proxians 
never run from a fight! They keep on going until they die! Or something.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He wanted us 
to fight Felix and the others right when they stopped us from killing Isaac and 
we were already tired...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My dear 
little sister, you still have much to learn. It is not stupidity, it is bravery.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then, what 
Felix tried to pull on Venus Lighthouse was bravery?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, <i>
that</i> was stupidity. He should have known he wasn't even a fair match for us.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... it was 
even okay for Agatio and I to keep fighting even when Jenna and Sheba came at 
Jupiter Lighthouse? Like he said?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Agatio 
does not give up. You shouldn't either.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... okay. 
I guess I understand.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess 
we've talked enough. Let's go now.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, 
alright.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... that 
was interesting...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, that's 
all we have!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Be sure to 
check out the guys' thoughts on us girls!</p>
