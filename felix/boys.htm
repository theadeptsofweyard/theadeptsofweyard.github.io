<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's our 
turn! We'll be saying stuff about the girls.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They won't 
know what we're saying, will they?<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We should 
just take care what we say.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... 
because the girls can be scary.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure it 
will be fine.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I bet nothing 
nice was said about me.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's talk 
about Mia. She's beautiful. No arguments.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia's really 
sweet and kind.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, she 
took care of an entire village.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's always 
looking out for people.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, Mia's 
so kind and... well, there's not a lot to say about her.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's 
definitely pretty.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That one 
time she was sarcastic was cool.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know! A 
pharmacy, inside a cave?<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And she kind 
of joined in on teasing Garet. Good for her.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey!<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not sure 
what I can say. Everything that can be said has been said.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ahh... Mia... 
she was always so quiet, sweet and kind... I really think Felix is a bit like 
her.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? 
Mia's not emo or suicidal enough.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not 
suicidal!<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There are 
similarities. You can see them if you look hard enough.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh... so 
Mia's a cute chick, sure.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She can be 
scary with a mace.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's like 
an angel... but just not dead.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What an odd 
thing to say...<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... That was 
random.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er, heh heh... 
shall we talk about Jenna now?<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Scary.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Violent.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can make 
witty one-liners.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's quite 
positive and upbeat. I like her personality.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's not 
too scary if you don't annoy her...<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna is so 
hot... *drools*<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stop 
drooling over my sister!<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet, 
that's gross. Get a napkin.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whoops. 
Sorry.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I seem to be 
remarkably good at annoying her. But then again I annoy everybody.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
Jenna is really cute too.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's so 
hot...<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's kind 
of noisy sometimes though.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can't we 
stick to saying nice things?<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think we 
should for our safety.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *whimpers* I 
don't want to get Jenna mad.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't think 
Jenna's so bad. She not as scary as certain Mars Adepts from a certain snowy 
village...<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna is 
surely mild compared to THEM.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't we 
talk about Sheba now...?<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba is a 
tattletale.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, she 
told on us for 'killing' Saturos and Menardi, didn't she?<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She didn't 
mean to send rampaging Mars Adepts after you.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I could have 
been killed, you know.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, come on! 
We saved you, didn't we?<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was 
rather close though. A few minutes longer... and he might have been killed.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Karst picked 
on me, but I'm not blaming Sheba for it. She must have just said it without 
thinking.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> True, we 
also didn't see how dangerous Karst could be at that point.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I find Sheba 
rather annoying and mouthy. That hair is awful.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding! 
It looks like a salad bowl or something!<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Was her 
stylist blind?<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, I don't 
think it's that bad! And Sheba is a... nice girl. I think. Although she's a bit 
of a tease.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She teased 
me. ._.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And also 
teased Jenna about me, making people think we were a couple. How annoying.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What were 
those Proxians thinking, taking a girl like that?<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Was she even 
worth jumping for?<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... You are 
hopeless.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You guys 
aren't being very nice. Sheba's not so bad.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I agree. 
Can't we be a little nicer toward her?<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
we've covered all the girls now.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That is 
not so! I am invading to speak of Menardi!<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll join 
in too!<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You kids 
keep quiet while we discuss the beautiful women of Prox.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay?<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am not a 
kid- *punched* Ow. That hurt. ._.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ahh, 
Menardi. She is truly a beauty.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like 
those shiny red scales.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Such 
radiant, blonde hair...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Her skin's 
a nice shade of pink too.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And those 
fingernails! Those beautiful crimson eyes! She is a beauty!<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's too 
bad her face is rather androgynous.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> HEY! 
What's that supposed to mean?<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Caz 
originally mistook her for a man when she wasn't paying attention to that first 
battle too, right?<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's the 
first battle got to do with it?<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Didn't you 
call yourselves Mystery Man and Mystery Woman or something? How cheesy.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We did not 
pick those names! And Menardi does look feminine! But if she didn't see "Mystery 
Woman"...<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those GBAs 
are pretty dark and she WAS playing at night.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But... 
but... Menardi is beautiful... she doesn't look like a man...<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Doesn't look 
much like a woman either.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Shut up, 
you brat! Then what about the hair? The long, flowing hair?<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *coughs and 
looks shiftily at Alex*<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh... but 
I still think Menardi is the most beautiful woman in Prox!<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now let's 
talk about Karst. Who actually looks feminine.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> One more 
remark on Menardi and I will...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That skirt 
of hers is quite short, isn't it?<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. I 
think she has the shortest skirt out of everyone.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Her outfit 
is pretty cool.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose 
Karst is pretty. But it's too bad about that temper of hers.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is a bit 
scary, isn't it? Who do you suppose is scarier, Menardi or Karst?<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's not 
bother saying. The sisters will probably team up against us in anger or 
something.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Their anger 
combined... sounds like a terrifying force.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But, hey, 
when are we Proxians not scary?<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Karst is 
kind of sweet though, when she's not in a bad mood.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
she gets confused easily...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. 
Picking on that midget at Jupiter Lighthouse... how strange. I thought it would 
be Isaac she would go for.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We may 
never know why she did that.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It sucks 
that we all died too.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... 
anyway, we're done.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
think that's everything.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now we have 
to hope the girls don't kill us.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And find out 
what they said about us.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Be sure to 
check out what they said!<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure we 
haven't said anything too bad. Some of you should just avoid Sheba for a while.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not sure I 
really want to know what they said about me...<br>
