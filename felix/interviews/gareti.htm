<p align="center">Garet's Interview</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Hello, Garet! You're up for an interview!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay! I've 
been waiting ages for one!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure you have 
*looks shifty* Uh anyway, ready? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one: 
What's your worst fear? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Vegetables.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? o.O;;; <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't 
stand eating them. I'm always scared someone will plonk down a huge plate of 
veggies in front of me and make me eat them! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_o; That's very 
fascinating, Garet. Question two: Jenna or Mia? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... 
well... they're both scary. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But Mia is 
just creepy with that mace and the way she hisses "Die, Alex" under her breath!&nbsp;
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why does she want 
Alex dead so much? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think I'd 
pick Jenna because she doesn't look like she's going to beat me senseless and 
laugh maniacally over my dead body. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think you should 
be treated for paranoia. Question three: Were you dropped on the head as a baby?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> WHAT? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's what many 
people seem to think at any rate. <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's so 
mean... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
know! Ask my parents! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure. Question 
four: How much hairgel do you use? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Lots. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... it didn't 
explode or anything? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope. I just 
use way too much hairgel. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. Question 
five: Have you ever used your hair in battle? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How would I 
do that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You know, spearing 
the monster on the end of your hair... <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think that 
would be a little difficult if I couldn't see the monster. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just pin them down 
and spike them! <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I prefer to 
use my sword... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Too bad. Question 
six: Are you aware your parents fail at spelling? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... what?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I mean, Garet fits 
into the five letter limit... but... <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But what?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The name is 
usually spelled with two r's or t's. <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, well, 
so? I'm unique! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course you are. 
Question seven: What's your favorite food? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like spicy 
food. The spicier, the better. But I don't get to eat it often. The people in 
Vale don't seem to like it that much...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The taste is 
preferred in certain regions after all. Anyway, question eight:&nbsp; Did you 
ever get punished for the flowers?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, by the 
time I got back home, Vale was destroyed... I guess she forgot anyway.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Lucky escape, huh? 
Question nine: What was in THAT chest? <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The one I 
was pulling in the storm? Food. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sighs in 
exasperation* Of course. Question ten:&nbsp; Did you ever figure out what 
grabbed your wrist?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nah. Maybe 
it was a ghost. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure... o_o Okay, 
let's see what everyone else thinks about Garet. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's my best 
pal... for some reason.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If Garet 
doesn't stop teasing me, I'll destroy him slowly and painfully.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I hate the 
fact Garet eats far too much. It's annoying.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet annoys 
me. I don't want that guy to be related to me. Ever.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet's kind 
of hot. And he's fun to tease...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll never 
forget the look on his face when I called him a poor baby.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet is 
noisy.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't care 
about Garet.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I 
wonder if he ever listened during our lessons...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kay.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet will pay 
for destroying my flowers one day, I swear to it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My big 
brother is cool!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Life is 
never dull with Garet around.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrsjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet 
eats too much. He keeps getting sick. I do wish he would be more careful.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garets_grandmother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
My grandson is very clumsy. He has a tendency to break things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/the_mayor.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet 
did a good job going on a quest and coming back alive. I'm impressed.<br>
<img src="../../icons/dora.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He destroyed 
my roof!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyle.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet always 
used to be tearing around our house with Isaac... and breaking things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_mother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Why does Garet like my cookies so much?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_father.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Garet ain't so bright, is he?<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet 
seems to be a bit hot-headed and acts very quickly. Sucks to be a Mars Adept, 
doesn't it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac is 
way hotter.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet is 
an annoying whelp. That is all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He talks 
too much.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
give a damn about that irritant.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A friend of 
Isaac is an enemy of mine!<br>
