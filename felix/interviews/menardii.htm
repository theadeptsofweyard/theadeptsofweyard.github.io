<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
._.;;; Um... it's time for your interview.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Make it 
quick. I haven't got all day.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why, are you going 
to a zombie convention?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't make 
fun of me being dead! We dead people are very sensitive!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep... Question 
one: Do you think Camelot deliberately set you up to look evil?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, duh. 
They gave us red eyes. I bet they did that so players would think we were evil!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... well, 
Chibiusa from Sailor Moon has red eyes and isn't evil...<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's all 
that Wise One's fault! Telling those twerps Alchemy would destroy the world! The 
nerve of that rock...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is rather 
unfair, isn't it? Question two: What would be a better name for the Fusion 
Dragon?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's 
wrong with Fusion Dragon?! We worked hard to come up with such an awesome, 
fearsome name!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's... kinda 
disappointing. It's like Camelot said "Oh, it's a dragon caused by two people 
fusing. Let's call it Fusion Dragon!"<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What were 
you expecting?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A slightly more 
original name. Still, it's better than "Mystery Man" and "Mystery Woman".<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... We 
did not pick those names.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: Do 
you find Saturos attractive?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly. 
He is a hot, sexy beast and I would do him in an instant. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... You could have 
just said yes. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
disagreeing?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course not. 
Saturos is the sexiest Proxian. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good. Then 
I won't have to... persuade you. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_O;;; Question 
four: Who do you think has the worst temper? You or Karst? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's 
that about my temper?! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's pretty bad.<b>
</b>But Karst has it bad too. I guess it runs in the family.<b> </b><br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... What's 
wrong with letting off steam once in a while? It's fun. Hurting people is fun 
too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er... ok. Question 
five: What did you think about Alex?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was 
hard to tell. The guy had too many secrets and was always disappearing. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A nasty habit 
indeed. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I 
could see... he was truly rotten to the core! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? o_O <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. He is 
pure evil. Duh. Isn't it obvious?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... No. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Of 
course. Because we're the ones causing a fuss and making the players forget all 
about him. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's not evil. ._. 
Question six: What did you do for three years? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hm? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Between rescuing 
Felix and the others and then finally returning to Vale... it was quite a while.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... 
we... well... ok, I don't know!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Three years is 
rather long to wait when you're worrying about a rift eating your hometown. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, duh! 
Blame Camelot! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: 
So... what does Death Size have to do with sizes? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That was a 
mistranslation and you know it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pretty whacked 
out. It just sounds funny. It's not even frightening.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's 
scythe, damn it. SCYTHE. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> At least Karst got 
it right. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It wasn't 
my fault! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Course not. 
Question eight: What are your hobbies? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Cutting 
things up. Drooling over Saturos. Oh, and burning stuff. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. o_o;;; <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is that a 
problem? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... No. Not at 
all. Question nine: Did you ever regret kidnapping Kraden? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heck, yes. 
I can't remember why we did it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because he knew 
stuff. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He sure 
wasn't afraid to talk about it. We put up with his constant droning for months!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Couldn't you 
threaten him into shutting up? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Tried. 
Didn't work. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That sucks... 
Question ten: Do you like being a martyr? <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's kind 
of alright. Just isn't so fun being dead. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... too bad 
you had to die... <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If I ever 
see that rock, I'll teach him pain! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... sure. 
Anyway, let's have everyone's thoughts on Menardi! <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She is 
really, really scary.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That scythe 
gives me nightmares...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Menardi is 
indeed fierce and powerful.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She has an 
awfully bad temper.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
think she's ever gone one day without yelling her head off or burning things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pfft. 
Menardi doesn't scare me!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's very 
skilled in battle, especially with that scythe.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What do you 
want me to say?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Menardi looks 
rather... mannish.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Quite 
frightening, yet enchanting...<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She is so 
sexy... *sigh*<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My sister is 
awesome!<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh, she's 
alright. A bit quick-tempered though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I still 
don't understand why I didn't see their true intentions... I guess I suck.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A 
frightening looking lady indeed. <br>
