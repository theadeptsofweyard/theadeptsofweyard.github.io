<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Well, it's time for your interview at last.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is there a 
reason I am the last Proxian to get it?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> &gt;_&gt; No... of 
course not... &gt;_&gt;; <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Everybody 
hates me! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one: 
Menardi or Karst? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... 
well... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whom do you 
prefer? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They are 
both terrifying... and... well... ._. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* No opinion 
then? Question two: Why did you pick on Isaac on Jupiter Lighthouse? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
didn't know which was whom, so I just picked one, right? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It would have made 
more sense for Karst to be fighting Isaac... <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> &gt;_&gt; I 
know... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: 
What are your hobbies? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Building 
snowmen, snowball fights, sledding... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You must be the 
first Mars Adept to not enjoy burning stuff. <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Writing my 
name in the snow... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_-; We didn't 
need to know that. Question four: What did you think of Alex? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *clenches 
fist* That smug bastard... I want to punch him... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I think 
it's Alex who everyone hates... <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is 
annoying and a shmuck and I wish I could have watched the Wise One smack him 
down. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Except the Wise 
One got to you first... <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ._. Stupid 
rock with an eye...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question five: 
What was it like being a dragon?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, I don't 
remember so well... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Was it fun? Scary?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm pretty 
sure I was mostly unconscious at the time, and I would just have been very 
confused anyway. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question six: What 
is your favourite animal?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kittens. 
And puppies. And fluffy bunny rabbits.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh? Really? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like cute 
little things that I can cuddle... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now that was 
unexpected... <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What were 
you expecting? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know 
really. I'm just asking random questions. <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: Do 
you consider yourself and Garet potential soulmates?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... wut.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's see... 
strange sticking up hair, both Mars Adepts, both seeming to lack some 
intelligence... <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do not 
lack intelligence! I just... uh... like fighting even when I stand a chance of 
losing! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The similarities 
are disturbing indeed. Or maybe male Mars Adepts just aren't particularly 
intelligent. <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> T_T I'm not 
an idiot! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The hair though... 
is eerily similar.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's 
nothing wrong with my hair either! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure... Question 
eight: Just what is that green armour made of? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, it's 
armour. What would it be made of? Metal, of course.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isn't it rather 
uncomfortable? I mean, it's surrounding your head, neck, shoulders. What are you 
trying to do, prevent decapitation? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think it 
looks cool! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Question nine: 
What is your favourite food? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Green jello!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Seriously? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh-huh. I 
can't get enough of the stuff! It's green too! My favourite colour! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten: Are 
you aware you will never be as cool, awesome and badass as Saturos? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are you 
picking on me like this? You're a Saturos fangirl, aren't you?! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Satty-kun is the 
best! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> T_T <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, let's see 
what everybody else thinks of Agatio.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> His Rising 
Dragon attack freaking HURTS.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's with 
the green? It's blinding. <br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's like an 
oversized version of Garet... <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That armour 
does look silly... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is his hair 
supposed to be lavender or something? How girly. <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos is 
much hotter than Agatio. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those flap 
things around his waist kind of look like a skirt. Maybe he has a feminine 
side... <br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's kind 
of frightening. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What kind 
of idiot doesn't care if the odds are piling up against them? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hah! I'm 
much cooler than Agatio, so there! <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Agatio is 
simply reckless and brave. It's not idiocy. <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe he's a 
masochist. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor 
guy, just wanted to save his hometown, and a one-eyed rock killed him.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stop asking 
me about people I've never even heard of!</p>
