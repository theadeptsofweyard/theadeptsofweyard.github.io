<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Hello, Wolfy.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My name is 
Maha, not Wolfy. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whatever. I'm 
gonna ask you some questions now. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... right.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one: Do 
you eat raw meat? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er... that's 
a very odd question... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just answer it 
already. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* No. 
Raw meat is gross. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh. That was 
unexpected. Question two: Do you like to howl at the moon? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I stay in my 
cave all the time. I rarely ever see the moon.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's so boring.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Better than 
strangers seeing me... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pssh. You're worse 
than the Valeans. Question three: If you bite someone, would they turn into a 
werewolf? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I sure hope 
they wouldn't. Not that I've actually bitten anyone... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four: Do 
you still have sex with humans? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
.................................. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, come on! Or do 
you save it for when they are transformed? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would 
rather keep such information to myself, thanks. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poo. Who would 
want to screw a werewolf anyway? Question five: Do you know the muffin man? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> WTF? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I bet you ate him, 
didn't you? Did he taste like muffins? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o.0 <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Muffins are yummy. 
Question six: Why are your teeth so big?<br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... are 
they? o.o I guess they are big, just because they are big...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: If 
you met Little Red Riding Hood, what would you do? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know 
who that is. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'd run away if I 
were you. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, thanks 
for the tip. I'll keep that in mind if I see anyone wearing a red hood... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: Do 
you get fleas? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... so what 
if I do? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Must be a pain.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. They 
itch a lot. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ok... Question 
nine: Why is thinking of questions so hard?<br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er, I really 
don't know why. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's funny, I 
don't know why either. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Maha.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Okay...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, I think we'll 
just see what everyone has to say about Wolfy now. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Dude. 
Werewolves? What's next? I sure hope it isn't vampires.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would hate 
to be covered in fur and looking like a freak all the time.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want to go 
to Garoh on the night of a full moon!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor Maha...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I still 
don't understand why exactly they turn into werewolves...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... he's 
cool, I guess. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder if 
he likes being petted? <br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I love how 
I'm so quiet in the Garoh scenes if I'm there, but at least Kraden bothers to 
mention my name when introducing us to Maha.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bleh. Who 
would want to be a nasty flea infested werewolf? Gross.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I LOVE 
WEREWOLVES~</p>
