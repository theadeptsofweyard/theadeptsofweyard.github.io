<p align="center">Feizhi's Interview</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Time for a new 
interview. This time, we have Feizhi here.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I shall do 
my best! Will Isaac see this interview? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Uh, he might.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh, I am 
feeling so nervous now... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Question 
one: Are you really that in love with Isaac?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Absolutely! 
I want nothing more than to be his wife! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I can see 
you have pretty intense feelings for him... <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is the 
most charming and handsome man in all of Weyard. *sigh* <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question two: What 
was your initial reaction to the Madra Blushing Scene? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was 
foaming at the mouth. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The mere 
thought of me having competition for Isaac's heart... I find it infuriating.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: 
Would you do anything for Isaac's heart?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
know what I must do to get his attention, but whatever it is, I'll do it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Even cooking live 
bunnies in a pot? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They say 
rabbit's feet bring you good luck in Xian. But it does not have to be cooked.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Congratulations. 
You missed the point. <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am sorry, 
what? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four! 
What do you think of Hsu?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hsu... he 
is a good friend, but is not as cool as Isaac. Compared to Isaac, he is quite 
ugly actually. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I couldn't agree 
more. And what kind of a name is Ulmuch?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do not 
know. It is strange how they suddenly not change his original name when they do 
before. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. Question 
five: Do you have eyesight problems? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What kind 
of a question is that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Go ahead, answer 
it then maybe I'll ask a different question for six. <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My eyes are 
perfectly fine, thank you. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? Are you 
sure? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes! I can 
read letters from a long distance if I look hard. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question six: How 
the heck did you manage to mistake Felix for Isaac in Champa then? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is that 
really so difficult to do? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course it is! 
Felix has long dark hair, Isaac has short blond hair. How can you even confuse 
one for another?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... I... 
really, I do not know how I managed it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you even 
remember what Isaac looked like? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of... of 
course I... did... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O RLY? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; It is 
not very nice to tease me. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: 
How did you manage to cross a mountain range by yourself? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think I 
did it very carefully. I do not know. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's kind of 
absurd. <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But it is a 
quick way from Xian to Champa. It is not so bad. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not as bad as 
Vault thieves getting from Angara to Indra anyway. I wonder how they did that... 
did they even have a boat?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Perhaps it 
is this thing called a plot hole?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sounds about 
right. Question eight:&nbsp; Is it fun to have voices in your head?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They are 
not voices in my head. It is just a gift of foresight. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And what are you 
seeing right now? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac 
marrying me. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I don't 
believe you. <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ._. Do not 
crush my hopes and dreams so cruelly! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question nine: Are 
you aware of what became of the ring? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, Isaac 
got it, right? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's no 
explanation about it or anything. Funny, that. Is equipping it on him the same 
as telling it you gave it to him? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You mean... 
they don't properly give it to him...? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Messages in Madra 
and Naribwe don't change. There's no extra Lemuria dialogue. They aren't told 
about Babi either. Lazy developers. <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; No! The 
old man promised!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Therefore it's 
your duty to go and punish him and tell Isaac the truth. <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The old man 
shall feel my wrath! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do you even 
remember what he looks like? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ... 
Uh. Maybe? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Never mind. Just 
go to the Temple of Kraden.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He has a 
temple? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten! What 
is your worst nightmare? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That 
someone else will claim Isaac's heart. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I thought 
as much... so, what does everyone think of Feizhi? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She seems a 
bit obsessed with me... it's a little creepy.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want to 
see her doing kung fu or whatever it was. Sounds cool.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think she's 
kind of cute, but a bit loopy...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If I'm ever in 
the way of her having Isaac, I won't back down. I'll fight to the death.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How could 
she mistake me for Isaac?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who does she 
think she is, fawning over Isaac like some brazen hussy?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Feizhi isn't 
going to kill me, is she?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
think she's that bad. Just madly in love...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I forgot 
about the ring, I swear! Don't let her kill me!<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Feizhi 
is one of my favourite students.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know 
who this girl is. Should I care?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are 
you asking me?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She 
seriously likes Isaac that much? I found him annoying.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is she 
on?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What a weird 
girl...</p>
