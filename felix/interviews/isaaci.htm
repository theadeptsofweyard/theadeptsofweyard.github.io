<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Hi, Isaac!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, hi... 
so, my interview? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yup, finally! 
Ready for some questioning? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okey-dokey. 
Question one: Why is it that when you talk you sound like a pompous, stuck-up, 
full-of-himself jackass who was much cooler when he didn't talk? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_o <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Wait, my bad. 
You're not the Isaac from the game. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If it's any 
consolation, I don't like my personality in the second game. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Nobody does.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, so 
next question?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question two: Do 
you have some robotic twin? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You just seem 
awfully robotic on Mars Lighthouse. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* How 
about we don't talk about my personality? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure. Question 
three: Is your mother a robot? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aren't these 
questions supposed to be about me? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If your spouse 
came back after three years, assumed dead, would you just say "Welcome home"?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please. Ask 
some real questions.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four: 
What is your most prized possession? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My scarf.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh huh. I've 
had this for as long as I can remember. My mom made it for me. Isn't it awesome?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It really is. 
Question five: So... why did you call out for Mia and not Garet on Jupiter 
Lighthouse?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... 
what's wrong with that?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Calling out for 
the pretty girl instead of your childhood and best friend? Interesting. And 
"Mia" was your first word...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My first 
word is "!!!"&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Admit it! Ah, 
never mind. Question six: Mia or Jenna? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is this a 
plot to enrage shippers? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like them 
both. I'm not saying whom I prefer... I would just rather not. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How chivalrous of 
you... Question seven: How do you feel about getting part of Alchemy? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, it 
irks me the Wise One didn't ask first... but then again, he was never entirely 
honest either. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding. You're 
probably a bit paranoid. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do expect 
Alex to jump out from behind a tree and kill me at some point. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Watch your back. 
Question eight:&nbsp; What is your worst fear?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That all my 
enemies will gang up and come after me. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er...? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, if the 
Colosso warriors decide on another rematch... and the Vault thieves... vengeful 
Proxians... Alex... Dodonpa...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, that will 
do. Gee, poor Isaac... Question nine: Did you ever try going to Lemuria? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I might 
have. But that Merman can't really be beaten without a trident so it would have 
been futile. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh huh. There 
should at least have been a scene if we returned with your party. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And those 
messages people had from me should have changed. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding. You're 
right there and the woman in Madra's still all "Isaac's looking for Jenna. Have 
you seen her?" Sheesh... <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They 
obviously couldn't be bothered to pay attention to detail. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten: Why 
were you stalking Picard? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> In Naribwe, you 
paid the innkeeper a hefty amount of money to ask people if they had seen 
Picard. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... 
money is... totally overrated...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Admit it! You're 
stalking Adepts!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> &gt;_&gt; Well...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or maybe Mia 
wasn't satisfactory enough and you wanted a new Water Adept. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is Picard 
honestly any better than Mia? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nah. He's too 
slow. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is that it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It sure is. Let's 
see what other people think of Isaac. <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac's my 
best friend. We've been together a long time.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac is a 
great warrior.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac's kind 
of cute.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Am I really 
a clone of him? ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish he 
wouldn't blindly listen to rocks.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why does 
Isaac always get credit? Nobody ever mentions Ivan, Garet or Mia. I feel sorry 
for them.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If Isaac 
stalks me again, I'll have words with him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder if I 
ask nicely, will he give me his power?<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am 
glad Isaac eventually came to his senses. He is a good warrior.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ISAAC IS SO 
HOT!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Darn twerp 
had to kill us before finally doing what we were doing in the first place!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's 
awfully quiet. I like that he was at least quiet.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I liked 
kicking his ass!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That jerk 
killed my sister!<br>
<img src="../../icons/dora.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> All I want is 
for my son to settle down and have a peaceful life.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyle.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac is very 
brave. He's fought a few dragons... and one of them was sort of me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_father.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
I actually got pwnt by him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_mother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
So did I.<br>
<img src="../../icons/the_mayor.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm glad 
Isaac is there to stop Garet from getting into mischief.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garets_grandmother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Isaac's a good boy. I do wish Garet could be more like him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac has 
a habit of popping up when you least expect him to.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrsjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Dora sure 
raised that child well.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac 
actually paid attention in my lessons. Unlike Garet and Jenna...</p>
