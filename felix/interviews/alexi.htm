<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
That's right everyone, interview time with our favourite non-evil guy, Alex!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It saddens me 
that one of the few people who thinks I'm not evil is a crazy psycho. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! I'm not a 
crazy psycho... and who told you my darkest secret? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Just ask 
the questions. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question One! How 
does it feel to be thought of as evil? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Like a 
million rusty spears piercing my very heart. Oh, how painful it is... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor poor Alex-sama. 
;_; <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It all 
started when Golden Sun: The Lost Age came out...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yep. Question two: 
Mia, Jenna or Sheba? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, Mia 
thinks I'm evil and hates my guts. Sheba's evil and creepy. So I'd say Jenna.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay! I think 
Zitshipping is a totally cute pairing. <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... yes. 
Sure. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question 3: What's 
your gender? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *spit-takes* 
Can't you tell I'm male?! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^_^ <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Just 
because I have long hair. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't tie it 
back either, which leads me to question four: Are you a hippy? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly 
not. Hippies make me sick. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You have nice 
hair, but you really need to do something about it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am a 
bishounen. It is required to have long, attractive hair flowing like silk. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question five: Do 
you spend an hour every morning taking care of your hair? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> An hour? That 
all? Certainly not! Three hours minimum. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No wonder you have 
such dazzling hair.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Verily much 
so. In fact, someday, I intend to open a hair care products range. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Cool! Have you got 
a name for it? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex's Hair 
Care: Buy or Die. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... No wonder 
crazy people think you're evil. <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I need the 
money! ;_; The Wise One mugged me and stole it all! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question six: Are 
you going to get your own back on the Wise One? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly. I 
am formulating an elaborate scheme. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I will find 
out the Wise One's favourite candy. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o.O The Wise One 
can eat? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then steal it 
all and put it on Mercury Lighthouse aerie. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay... <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> On the 
Mercury Lighthouse, my power is increased after all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. ^.^ <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When the Wise 
One comes to claim his precious candy, I will leap out from hiding and attack 
him! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay! Go, Alex-sama! 
♥ Good luck. ^_^ <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm glad to 
have some support. T.T People keep egging me, calling me evil and stuff... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: 
Does a sexy, young bishounen like you get plenty of fan mail? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, back in 
the day, I used to get some. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Back in the day?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> However, when 
Golden Sun: The Lost Age came out, I got considerably less... fan mail. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aww. <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I still got 
mail though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh? o.O <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hate mail. 
People sent me flaming bags of poo for example, and even rude notes saying 
things I cannot repeat. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because they 
thought you were evil? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, yes. I 
kept getting letters calling me an evil... insert expletive here. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. Question 
eight: Do you want to know if you lived or not? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would like 
to. But I'm scared that if Camelot made a sequel, I'd do something ultra lame 
like going after Isaac. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, that worries 
me too. Doesn't it seem Camelot warped your character? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If they 
hadn't created me, their HQ would be a smoking crater... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... That aside, 
they made you obnoxious and annoying in TLA. You were like a completely 
different person. <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, yes, 
indeed. I cannot understand it myself. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I preferred you in 
the first game. ;_; <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
everybody did. &gt;.&gt;; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Question 
nine: Was it really you in The Lost Age? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, if it 
wasn't me, who was it then? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't have an 
evil twin who impersonates you, do you? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Evil twin... 
that's a cheesy way to explain my altered character. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kinda clichéd, 
yes, but it's better than thinking you're evil. T.T <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I'm not. 
T.T <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten: Why 
did you insult everyone in Champa? <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It wasn't me. 
It was my evil twin. &gt;.&gt; *shifty eyes* <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex! <br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, they 
upset me by replacing me with Picard, so I was upset... and I said things... I 
didn't mean them, really. ;_; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There, there... 
now what does everyone think about Alex? <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's okay 
but I'm not sure I want him dating my sister... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is hot 
and sexy and adorable and awesome and bishy and good-looking and handsome and 
amazing and incredible and- OW! Who threw that? ;_; <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't care 
what anybody says. Alex sucks. Because I said so. <br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He called 
me an amateur Water Adept. I am not. <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex isn't 
really going to come after me, is he? ;_; I don't want him to... <br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Death to 
Alex! <br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is... 
mysterious for sure. He's very polite yet mystifying. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> EVIL! <b>
EEEEEEVVVIIIILLLLLL!!!</b> <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex saved 
me on the Mercury Lighthouse. He's okay. <br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, 
considering he saved my Satty-chan, I suppose Alex's not so bad. <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want to 
smash his face in. Can I? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is 
annoying. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I never 
met the guy, why are you asking me? <br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If this 
Alex dude hurts my precious Isaac, I will remove something he will most 
definitely miss. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is a 
nosy person, but I cannot judge him for that. I just wonder why he wants to be 
immortal and stuff...<br>
