<p align="center">Saturos's Interview</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Hi, it's time for your interview.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are we 
Proxians last? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not necessarily 
last. There are still other Adepts and we have guest interviews too... <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. Ask 
away. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one: Are 
you and Menardi an item? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... It's 
hard to be an item when you are dead. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ... <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, 
Menardi's hot. I'm hot. Hot people go together. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh, ok. Question 
two: Do you consider yourself a martyr? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly. 
I died trying to protect my hometown. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: 
Why didn't you just sit down and talk to Isaac? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, they 
were trying to stop us and stuff, we couldn't let them. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Annoying, weren't 
they? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four: Did 
you ever trust Alex? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Certainly 
not. I always knew he was plotting something. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you do have 
trust issues, I suppose. <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He always 
had this smug grin and he's just so annoying as well. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did it surprise 
you he was plotting to take over the world? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was dead 
then! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Question 
five: How did you two manage to get four people all the way to your ship? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Very 
carefully. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A young boy, no 
problem. But three fully grown adults? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I 
said, <i>very </i>carefully.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That makes no 
sense. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It made no 
sense when Camelot randomly threw something like that in. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder if they 
simply did that without thinking of the possible plothole. <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wouldn't 
surprise me. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question six: So 
why did you really kidnap Kraden? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> For his 
knowledge. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You sure you 
weren't just feeling majorly masochistic? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Such 
masochism is worth it to save your hometown! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you ever just, 
you know, gag him? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
kidding? That old man can't be gagged! He will continue to talk and talk! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yikes. <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He will 
talk until the end of the world and the last thing anyone will remember is the 
talking of Kraden. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O...k. But the 
world's not ending. Yet. <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> At least 
now innocent people don't have to die.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're pretty 
bitter. Question seven: What gender is the Fusion Dragon? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh. You're 
kidding, right? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nope. Is it male, 
female or hermaphrodite? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I 
guess hermaphrodite. It was a combination of Menardi and I, after all. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The joke never 
gets old for me. ^_^ <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not 
even that funny. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: 
Why didn't you kidnap Sheba in Tolbi or something? She only landed in your hands 
by chance! <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's 
strange, it really is. Maybe we knew she was coming that way eventually. But 
lighting Venus Lighthouse was important. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess you just 
like to leave it up to chance, huh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There is 
nothing I cannot do! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question nine: How 
did you get through the Lamakan Desert if you need Reveal at that doorway with 
the Manticore? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... 
Plothole. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thought so. Is the 
fact you somehow got through the door at Venus Lighthouse though we need Reveal 
to do that also a plothole? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There are far too 
many plotholes concerning you people. Without Carry, getting through Venus 
Lighthouse should be difficult too. <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Plothole. 
All plotholes. But remember, Alex can warp. Say he warped us everywhere. Problem 
solved. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So Alex is the 
Deus Ex Machina to deal with plotholes? <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Precisely.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It does explain 
how Agatio, Karst and Alex got into Jupiter Lighthouse. <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Convenient, isn't he? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten: 
Where was Alex when you guys were hanging around Vale? It's odd. Felix was even 
in the inn.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Alex 
was always going off by himself. Plotting to take over the world, no doubt. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... sure. 
Whatever you say... <br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is 
rotten to the core. Can't you see it? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> v_v Let's see what 
everyone thinks of Saturos! <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos is a 
powerful warrior. At least I won't have to fight him ever again.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A guy that 
can turn into a dragon is pretty scary...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll never 
forgive him for laughing like that on Venus Lighthouse. I had nightmares for 
weeks.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos and 
Menardi hurt a lot of people. Even if they had their reasons, it still wasn't 
very nice.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's 
obsessed with kidnapping. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's not as 
temperamental as Menardi.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's sad he 
and Menardi died trying to save his hometown. What's wrong with tattling on 
their killer?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I never 
even met him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, if 
I can foresee stuff, why didn't I foresee their true intentions? That's weird. I 
only seemed to see Felix's burden or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is a 
scary looking man.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's he got 
against me? I'm not trying to take over the world!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos is 
hot. Sexy. And stuff. Can't you see it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos is a 
great warrior. He's strong and scary. Just how a Proxian should be.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pfft. I 
could beat him in a fight. I know I could.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's that 
about me talking too much? What a mean person!</p>
