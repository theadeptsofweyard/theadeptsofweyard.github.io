</p><p><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Pow pow Picard!
=D
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... You
love saying that, don't you?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> But of course!
I'm one of the OBHL!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So, you
have to ask me questions, don't you?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Uh-huh! Question
one- what do you think of the name Piers?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> *twitches*
I... hate it...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Pretty much all
the OBHL do, you're not alone.
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It's pretty
lame, you know? A pier's a dock, isn't it? Plus it sounds like the name
of some snobby guy...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It kinda sounds
French as well... but Lemuria's not France!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Indeed...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> And you lack
ze accent aussi...
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Please,
don't speak French... I don't know any...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Questionne numero
deux: Vous voulez couche avec moi?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Translation.
Please.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hah. Question
two: Will you sleep with me? ^_-
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> And I
thought the butt-pinching from rabid OBHL was bad... no!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Aww... you have
broken my heart!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... Too
bad.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> -_- Um... number
three. How old are you? =D
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I'm not
telling!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Please?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> No.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> PLEEEEEAAAAAASE?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> No.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Meanie. Question
four! Why don't you go and beat Akafubu up for stealing your Orb?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I wanted
to, but they wouldn't let me!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> They?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yeah!
Felix, Jenna, Sheba and Kraden! Well, I'm not sure about Sheba, but Kraden
got on my case about how I shouldn't, Felix was scared into telling me
not to and Jenna was ranting on about how beating people up would just
land me back in jail again.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question five,
do you want to go back to jail?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... No.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> How come?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Jail stinks.
They tease me, and the food is rubbish. Why would I want to go back?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yeah... but Alhafra's
jail is worse than Madra's.
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It is?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Uh-huh, the Alhafran
Mayor's not in Madra.
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Point.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question six!
What's with that weird rag on your wrist?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Wristbands
are in, aren't they?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, for the
skater type, I guess, but you don't skate!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> The fashions
of your weird world confuse me anyway.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> The fashions
of your world are pretty weird anyway. Nobody wears ponchos.
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It's a
Lemurian thing... I guess the rag is some good luck charm or something.
I'm not accustomed to carrying around rabbit feet after all.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I can't believe
people even eat rabbits, it's so mean! Rabbits are cute and sweet... sigh...
question seven, when are you going to have the big showdown battle with
Conservato? The one with lots of violence and blood and swordfighting and
stuff? That one?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I don't
go for beating up cranky, weak, wrinkly old men, I'm afraid...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Oh, admit it!
You want to push Conservato off the cliff! Why else wold Lemuria have cliffs?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well,
you could say that the 'Lem' in Lemuria is the same as in Lemmings...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So people tend
to jump off the cliffs a lot in Lemuria?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well,
when you are bored and get fed up with living for thousands of years, jumping
off the cliff is a pretty quick and efficient way...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> o.o; Why don't
you overtake the Senate and send them all to their dooms? You could become
ruler of Lemuria!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I'm afraid
I might have to kill King Hydros to do that, and I actually like King Hydros...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Killjoy. Question
eight! Don't you find it funny that one of your classes is Captain?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Um...
why would I?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Because, you
know, Captain Picard?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> *twitches*
I dislike being called Captain Picard...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So you do know
about Star Trek?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... I
take little interest in it.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Jeez... lighten
up, Piers! Question nine! Are you glad to have one of the biggest fandoms
around?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I would
be happier if they stopped screaming and fainting every time I looked at
them, and stopped groping my butt...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Have any of them
proposed to you yet?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Are you
kidding? Proposals and love letters and the like fall onto my doormat every
day.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, you are
popular. Question ten, what's the weirdest thing anybody ever sent you?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> An obsessed
fangirl once sent me this badly written fic about me and a Mary Sue...
and...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yikes... do you
get weird items?
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Toenail
clippings...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yuck!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Somebody's
entire head of hair... I guess they shaved it all off...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Wow...
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It's insanity.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, you are
a popular guy! Let's see what everybody has to say about you!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He's a
wuss. A very big wuss.
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I WANT
TO KNOW HIS AGE!
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Why do
people think we're a couple just because we're standing next to each other
in the ending cartoon?!
<br><img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It's odd
to think he might be older than me...
<br><img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I want
a fanbase! I don't even have one! Why?!
<br><img src="../../icons/garet.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Captain
Picard... hah hah! That's too funny!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He needs
to chill, let his hair down, lighten up more often.
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So long as
he doesn't like Alex, he's good!
<br><img src="../../icons/kinghydros.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Piers
is a very good boy, I'm proud of him.
<br><img src="../../icons/lunpa.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Lemuria's
popular all because of Piers. Impressive.
<br><img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He's
incredible, I never thought anybody could get slower than Garet, but somehow
Piers did it.
<br><img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> How can
I comment when I wasn't even in the same game?
<br><img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> No comment...
<br><img src="../../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Annoying,
a pest. How can they all love him?
<br><img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He is
one of the people who helped Isaac. He sucks.
<br><img src="../../icons/alex.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> My hair
is better than his so I don't care.
<br><img src="../../icons/briggs.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I still
can't understand why they thought he was one of my group. They all look
the same!
<br><img src="../../icons/chaucha.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He helped
fix the ship so we could escape Alhafra, he rocks.
<br><img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Um...
he was there when I mistook Felix for Isaac, wasn't he? Uh, he's good looking,
but Isaac's way sexier!
