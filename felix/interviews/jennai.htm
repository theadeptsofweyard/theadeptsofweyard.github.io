<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ohh, Jenna, it's 
interview time!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No! I'm 
still mad I was picked FOURTH!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You know, I could 
always link to my Fanfiction.net profile and your fanfiction section would be... 
unrequired as such...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But why was 
I fourth?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Someone had to 
be fourth... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, so 
what questions you gonna ask?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one! Did 
you cry on Mars Lighthouse? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What kind of 
a dumb question is that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just find it odd 
you deny crying over your parents... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So if you weren't 
crying, were you going "My parents are dying. Oh well =D"?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Okay, 
fine, so I cried! But everyone was teasing me about it...&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You started it!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did not! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did too! <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We could go 
on like this forever... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, question 
two. Was Sheba right or wrong? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I 
believe that is up to the fandom. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... but if 
Sheba had teased you about Garet, she would have been right. ^_^ <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You 
Flameshipper... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I love 
Flameshipping! Question three, did you ever duel Menardi to the death? Well... 
not death... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think she 
wanted it. But Felix didn't... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Menardi would have 
kicked your butt anyway... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four! 
Would you marry a guy whose last name is Talia? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is this a 
trick question? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Yes. <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... wait, 
so if I get their last name... and my name would be... Jenna Tali... HEY! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... She figured it 
out! <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Dang. I 
never realized that... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. You also 
share a name with a porn star. <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> .......... 
are you trying to turn me off my name? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, I like your 
name! Question five! What are your pet hates? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bad hair 
days... I can't stand them... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ehh, not nice at 
all... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba, when 
she gets in that irritating teasing mode... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, at least she 
doesn't do it that often... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> People who 
take way too long to do things... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed, we 
impatient ones have it hard... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I mean, how 
do people manage to have patience? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Very 
carefully. <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, and that 
scumbag of an Alhafran Mayor! He made a pass at me and Sheba once! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> In that cutscene 
where he did the heart emoticon and Felix got all jumpy and pissy? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, that 
one! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Wait a minute, 
Felix said he would punch the Alhafran Mayor if he made a pass at you... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Well, 
Kraden and Picard might not have approved of his violence... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stupid old men.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Picard's an 
old man? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, he's 
Lemurian! He must be over a hundred years old or something? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; 
Kraden's so annoying. You know that question Felix gets when Kraden asks if we 
should stay at the Mayor's house?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh, yeah? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And even if 
you say 'No', Kraden makes us stay! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Let's throw 
him on a bonfire. <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden AND 
the Alhafran Mayor! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah! <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bonfires 
rule! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay for bonfires!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^_^ <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, back to the 
questions. Question six,&nbsp; have you ever set fire to anything?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course. I 
even set someone on fire once. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was kind 
of an accident. I was just getting into my powers and this guy was annoying me 
so... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_O Was he okay?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, he 
jumped into the river screaming... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... wow.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I also set 
Felix's cape on fire once. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was aiming 
for Sheba and hit his cape by accident. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O_O <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She claimed 
I dyed my hair with raspberry juice! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Fascinating. 
Question seven, why didn't you ever get to go to Vale, Lalivero and Tolbi on 
your journey? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wanted to! 
But Sheba was scared of being made to stay at Lalivero, Kraden didn't like the 
idea...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I would have 
wanted to go back to the older places.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Everybody 
wanted to. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; Vale... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ._. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos and 
Menardi ruined it all by going berserk. AND Alex... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Yeah.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight,&nbsp; 
why do you flirt with everything that moves?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I... I... I 
do not! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You flirted with 
Garet... and Alex... and... uh... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I didn't 
flirt with Alex! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You did at the 
Venus Lighthouse! ... wait, was it the other way around? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Alex's a 
jerk. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... but I'm 
sure there was flirting. <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure you 
hallucinate frequently too. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question nine... 
are you aware that the Valean blacksmith guy... well, blacksmith's son but his 
father died in the storm... has a crush on you? <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, and I 
don't give a crap. =D <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^^ Of course not. 
You prefer Isaac or Garet... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Ooh, 
nice way not to enrage shippers... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I'm SURE I 
enraged a Ketchupshipper or Zitshipper somewhere XD <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Uh...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But they are rare 
anyway.&nbsp; Question ten! Um, what's your worst fear?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... With all 
that's happened in my life you ask me that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Come to think 
of it, you thought you'd lost your family for three years... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... but, 
I'll go with... queues. Queues are my worst fear. The longer, the worse they 
are. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then it's a good 
thing you weren't at Colosso... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It looked like a 
nightmare out there... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_o;;; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ok, let's see what 
the others think of our favourite fiery Mars Adept... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's my 
little sister but... sometimes she scares me...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna's hot! 
^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna shouts 
too much... o_O;;;<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I WILL find 
out her deepest, darkest secrets! MUAHAHAHAHA!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's 
nosy... ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna's... 
well, she's clever sometimes... and... I guess she's pretty...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna's a nice 
girl, but she's very loud.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sometimes 
she yells at me because I'm slow... but at least she listens to me and doesn't 
call me a stupid old fart...<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She argues 
too much...<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna's 
quite a little rebel...<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Honestly! 
I wanted to set her on fire so many times!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't give 
a crap about her.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Me neither.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
most of you are being far too negative about her... I'm sure she's a kind, sweet 
girl really underneath that temper...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_father.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
... I think she changed quite a bit in three years, but I could be imagining 
things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_mother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
I'm glad she turned out so well even without us...<br>
<img src="../../icons/dora.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Jenna? I 
should tell her running onto peoples' roofs and screaming isn't socially 
acceptable...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyle.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's a 
rather boisterous girl, but that's okay.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrsjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I'm 
sure she wouldn't make bad daughter-in-law material...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna's 
very vocal... but I'm all for free speech.<br>
<img src="../../icons/the_mayor.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I used 
to worry she might burn the village down...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garets_grandmother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
She's a lovely girl. I think. Or was that...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kay.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Me and Jenna 
weren't that close... she thought I was lame for liking flowers so much...<br>
<img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna's 
pretty funny, she teases Garet a lot!<br>
