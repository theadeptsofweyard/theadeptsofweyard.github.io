<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
It's time for your interview.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, I 
know. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I 
foresaw that the time would come when I would be interviewed. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... right... 
Question one: Do you know what questions I'm going to ask you? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, I 
do. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Doesn't that take 
the fun out of things? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh... Question 
two: Seriously, how old are you? Like, forty? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Much 
less than that... maybe around thirty... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You just seem 
really old to have a fifteen year old sibling. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's 
not impossible. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, but it's still 
uncommon. Before TLA came out, people thought you were Ivan's mom. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I 
really look that old? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To the fandom, you 
do. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... 
Urge to kill self... rising... T_T<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: 
Where the heck is your father? He isn't even mentioned...&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have 
no idea. The people of Contigo just say my mom died after giving Ivan away.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Geez... the 
distinct lack of character background is quite a nuisance. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would 
assume it is... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four: So, 
is it spelled Hama or Hamma? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That is 
a lame question. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Got your 
birth certificate? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We have 
birth certificates? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. Translators 
are silly people. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
it would be better to go with the spelling that came first, yes? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, that's what I 
think too. Question five: Do you have pet llamas? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am 
not sure why you think I would have pet llamas. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isn't it obvious? 
Lama Temple?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
have llamas for that matter, but they are okay. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right... Question 
six: Do you foresee a Golden Sun 3? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am 
afraid I cannot divulge any information on future games. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why not? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Camelot 
might sue me and I would rather not risk it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... okay then... 
Question seven: How do you know Kraden from before the journey? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just 
happened to meet him once, that's all. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, really?<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are 
you so curious about it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you know, 
some people don't seem to mind pairing you with him. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> For the 
last time, I'M NOT THAT OLD! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Could have fooled 
me. Question eight: So, uh... Feizhi, your student, has purple hair.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's 
not a question. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wasn't finished. 
Isn't it a really strange coincidence? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just 
because purple is an uncommon hair colour? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yep, and I don't 
see any other purple haired women around. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's a 
coincidence. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure... you never 
got real friendly with Feh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's. 
A. Coincidence.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Question nine: 
If Nyunpa is a Jupiter Adept, is he from Contigo? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I 
barely remember the guy's existence, let alone knowing where he comes from. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was weak to 
randomly have a Jupiter Adept somewhere and never explain their origin. <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Considering every other Jupiter Adept has their background explained or hinted 
at, I guess so. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Silly writers... 
Question ten: Is Alex dead or not? <br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
know. And shouldn't these questions be about me? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're just not a 
very interesting character... so it's difficult to come up with more specific 
questions.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* 
That sucks. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, uh, let's see 
what everyone else has to say.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
think she's that old. She does seem very wise though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh, I 
thought she was about forty...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have a 
long-lost emotionally distant relative. I feel so loved... ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Her 
mind-reading skills were kind of scary at first.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She really 
does look like that Feizhi chick... a bit...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, if it 
hasn't got anything to do with llamas, why is it Lama Temple?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is there 
some secret behind her knowing Kraden?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
she's alright.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's so 
bad about me knowing her?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Master Hama 
is a great teacher.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Looks old 
to me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
care.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whatever.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know 
who she is.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish I 
could see the future...<br>
