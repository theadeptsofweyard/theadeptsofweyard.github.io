<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> As 
a member of the Temple of Kraden, I have been deemed worthy to interview him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; 
Indeed, I am pleased to spread my teachings to unsuspecting visitors to this 
worthy site.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm afraid that's 
not quite the point... oh, worthy sage.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am not 
just worthy. I am uber worthy.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Excuse me?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is a 
higher standing that is difficult for mere mortals to even understand. But, by 
following my- <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, okay, that 
will do. Please allow me to ask my questions. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ask me as 
many questions as you would like and I will answer them all with as much depth 
as I possibly- <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one! 
What's it like travelling with a bunch of teenagers? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thankfully, 
they are so willing to listen to my wise words that it was a pleasant 
experience. At times, I did feel as if I was some kind of child minder but- <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. That will 
do. Question two! Who is the most respectful? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would say 
Piers is, but then again, he is rather old too. You just cannot see his age. The 
others... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix, Jenna and 
Sheba? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix is 
quite a handful. He is rather rash and rebellious at times, but he usually 
behaves himself. Jenna is loud and impatient. Sheba serves only to tease. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> However, I 
love them all and I love to teach them all my knowledge that they will never 
need to know, because they must go down the right path in life by following 
my... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Teachings, yes. 
._. Question three, is it necessary to talk so much? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If I cannot 
talk as much as I do, then it is not quite so possible for me to go about in 
teaching people what knowledge I have to impart. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? Um, I 
mean, I understand... Question four: Does the Temple truly exist in Weyard? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It does. 
But only the truly worthy can see it, let alone go about finding it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And...? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Part of 
this exercise requires going on the quest for the great Wheat Sword. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question five: Do 
you own a Wheat Sword? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I certainly 
do. There is only one Wheat Sword however, but because I am truly worthy, I own 
it no matter what. Just because Felix can wield it... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't quite get 
it, but there are non-believers who say the Wheat Sword does not exist. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They are 
misled, they believe the lies of those who go against the Wheat Sword. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This interview has 
got to be the strangest yet. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But 
certainly the most worthy, is it not? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm about to 
strike that word from the dictionary. Question six: Are you truly greater than 
Chuck Norris? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That I am. 
Anybody who says otherwise is not one of my followers. For my followers believe 
in me and hold me in the highest esteem. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: 
Who's hotter, Jenna or Mia?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
would say Jenna since...<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, okay, please 
stop answering it. I do not wish to know anymore than that.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. Do 
continue to keep on asking questions. I swear to answer them all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: 
Who is truly the most powerful being on Weyard? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am. Not 
even the Wise One wielding all of Alchemy could even match up to my supreme 
power. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay. Question 
nine: What is down Gaia Falls?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That is the 
greatest secret of all time that not even I have yet discovered. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let me know if you 
do! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I have 
heard many a suggestion to go find out for myself. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That does not 
surprise me. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed, I 
have a great many foes out there. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe if you had 
talked less... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But that 
would simply not do! My followers wish to hear each and every single one of 
these words that comes from my mouth... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, that's 
enough. Question ten: What are your thoughts on... being paired with Piers? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Though 
Piers may actually be my age, which he does not wish to reveal, I find it a 
little strange in that he looks like a teenager after all and... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ok, time's up. 
Thank you for the interview! Now what do people think about Kraden? <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't make 
me travel with him again! ;_; Please?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden gets 
giddy too easily. It's kind of frustrating.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I really 
thinks Kraden talks too much.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am not 
going to tell you if I'm near Kraden's age or not.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I actually 
kind of enjoyed that time without him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I kept 
falling asleep during his classes. Am I unworthy?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden 
doesn't bother me too much.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I simply try 
to ignore him when I am not in the mood for his lectures.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was so 
happy to finally get to run away and be free of that rambling old man.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why did we 
even kidnap him again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I couldn't 
sleep for weeks...<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
give a damn about that old man.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who cares 
about stupid old Kraden?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He said he 
would give that ring to Isaac! He promised me! Yet...<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden 
is ok. But... how exactly do we know each other again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/dora.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was worried 
about Isaac spending so much time with him. I thought Isaac might... warp.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyle.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I've 
forgotten how annoying Kraden used to be. The memories just came rushing back...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_father.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Poor Jenna, having all those lessons with that old man... and then Felix and 
Jenna having to travel with him...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_mother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
At least he took good care of our children.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden 
knows a lot. It's amazing.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrsjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He truly 
is an astounding old man.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garets_grandmother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Kraden sure is good-looking.<br>
<img src="../../icons/the_mayor.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kraden 
kept the number of visitors to Vale down. That saved us a lot of work actually.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kay.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thank goodness 
I never went to his lessons.<br>
<img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't 
understand most of what Kraden says. <br>
