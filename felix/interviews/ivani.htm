<p><br>
</p><p><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hi, Ivan! =D
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> You seem
to be a little hyper...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yup, yup! ^_^
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Is that
a good or a bad thing?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Depends on how
you look at it!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Right. So...
you gotta ask me a bunch of questions?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yep. Funny thing
is, today I did a different interview for school work... this will be so
much more fun!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Uh, that's
nice.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question numero
uno! What's your worst fear?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Do you just
intend to recycle questions or something?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> PLEEEAAAASE?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Um, Mary
Sues, Power abusing authors and over-enthusiastic FBM... *shudders*
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> What's wrong
with over-enthusiastic FBM?!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> They always
glomp me too tightly.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> *sigh* Question
number two... do you actually really use Reveal for perverted things?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> No! People
who make that joke are so mean! I'd never do such a thing!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ah, all sweet,
innocent and angelic aren't you?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Bleurgh!
I am not!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 3...
why were you looking at Kraden in the picture at the ending?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> WHAT ARE
YOU IMPLYING?!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Lets just say
that some people have their in-jokes about that...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> You sick
little...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Seriously though,
Kraden's annoying! Don't tell me you want to be his friend!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Actually,
we don't get a choice... <i>he</i> befriends <i>us</i>...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Why didn't you
just look at Mia or something?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Mia was
looking at Garet!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Huh... you better
be more careful in future, boy!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> My name's
Ivan, not boy.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 4! What
do you think of when you see the word 'Ivanhoe'?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I get the
very nasty feeling someone's trying to call me a ho and get away with it!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Too bad, isn't
it? You're only 15, far too young to be a ho, I think...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I'm not
even sure what a ho is, I just know it's a bad word.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, I'm not
sure I even can clarify it...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Do me a
favour and don't bother.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 5! How
do you feel about the fact the principal of my school shares your name?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I'd say,
who gave your school principal the rights to my name?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> If it's any consolation,
I think of you whenever I see the name Ivan! ^_^
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yay... I
think... are there any <i>other</i> Ivans you know of?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan the Terrible...
*laughs*
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> That better
not apply to me.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Course not. Question
six... are you <i>really</i> a midget?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> No! It's
not my fault I'm the smallest, I'm just younger than the others!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yeah, not fair,
is it? I'm 17 and only 5'3''!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Some people
are very insensitive about my height...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Its still pretty
funny to call you midget though!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> How about
you don't mention that word again in my presence and I'll let you live,
okay?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ooh, your threatening
style is so subtle! I like!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Was that
sarcasm?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Maybe, maybe
not.
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Sometimes
you confuse the heck outta me...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Cool! Question
seven, how come you have the Triforce on your cape?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> What?! That's
not the Triforce!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Yes it is!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It's not!
It's just three brass pieces slotted together with triangles on them!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Exactly! It's
the Triforce!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It's the
<i>wrong</i> shape!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It still looks
a <b>bit</b> like a triforce...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Whatever...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question eight...
which is a better place to live? Kalay or Contigo?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Finally,
a serious question! Well, I grew up in Kalay, but I was born in Contigo...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, Contigo's
cooler, it gives you <i>two</i> djinn and you can play games there and
get corn and, um, my sister lives there!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Kalay, on the
other hand...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Only has<i>
one</i> djinn and nothing else really...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So your answer's
Contigo then?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Sure, Contigo's
ace! You can get to Anemos Sanctum from there too!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Anemos Sanctum's
known for being scary and dangerous, isn't it?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, considering
Dullahan lives there... yep.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Look! Dullahan's
behind you!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> *screams
and turns around* What the...?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hah! Gotcha!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> That wasn't
very nice...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question number
nine! Have you ever read someone's mind and discovered something you shouldn't
have?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Um, well,
I've mind read loads of people...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Discover any
deep secrets?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, usually
just stuff like someone having stolen something, stuff like that.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Never read any
naughty thoughts by accident?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Um, not
really, no.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Probably just
as well. Okay, last question! Are you ever going to confront Moapa and
try to get the Shaman's Rod back?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> No, not
really.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> What?! But you
made such a big deal about it in the beginning!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It was very
lame as a weapon, plus I don't really need it anymore.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well... okay.
I had fun interviewing you... now it's time to see what others say about
Ivan!
<br><img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan...
he's my little brother, and he's very sentimental... still a kid at heart,
I suppose.
<br><img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He really
is useful, with his nifty Psynergy...
<br><img src="../../icons/garet.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan is
a midget! Nyah! He annoys me most of the time.
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan is a
cutie!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Huh? The
blond moptop? Well, he's helpful...
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> One Jupiter
Adept is bad enough, but two is absolutely awful! Still, I'm not complaining...
so long as they don't annoy me, either of them.
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Me and
Ivan love to plot devious things together in secret!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan freakily
looks a lot like Sheba...
<br><img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> What's
so bad about us exchanging looks? He's just a nice boy! Everybody else
ignores me...
<br><img src="../../icons/lordhammet.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I
raised Ivan well over 15-odd years! See? He's polite, smart and everything!
<br><img src="../../icons/ladylayana.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan
seems to be recklessly stubborn sometimes... I <b>told</b> him not to rescue
Hammet and he still did...
<br><img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ivan is
Master Hama's brother? That is good.
<br><img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Wasn't
Ivan the one who always went down first?
<br><img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He's
the scrawniest of the group...
<br><img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> A very
annoying boy!
<br><img src="../../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hah hah!
I beat him in a fight!
<br><img src="../../icons/alex.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So long
as Ivan does not touch my beautiful hair or try to take Alchemy instead
of me, I don't care about that kid or what he does.
