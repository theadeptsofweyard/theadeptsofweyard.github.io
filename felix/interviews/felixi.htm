<p><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hi!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ...I have
to be interviewed first?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Of course!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> (Help me!)
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Basically, I
just ask you a bunch of questions, alright? ^_____^
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... Go
ahead.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> First question
is: What is your secret? How do you make yourself look so sexy and adorable?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Why do
I get the feeling I'm the only one who's getting asked that question?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Come on, Felix!
The guys might want to know!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Perhaps
it's because you're a sucker for long dark hair and brown eyes?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It could be that...
Question two! What scares you most?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Cats.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> o_O;;; Um...
why? ^_^;;;
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I had this
nasty experience when I was about five years old. I was playing with a
cat and it turned evil and tried to scratch my eyes out!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Did you pull
its tail?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I shall
not answer that... and what peeves me most of all is that I have to SHARE
MY NAME WITH A CAT!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Poor Felly...
Question 3: Whats your first ever memory?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Trying
to steal some of my mom's cookies she had made. They were on the kitchen
table, I tried to climb up, then Jenna came in and started shouting some
stupid two-year-old gibberish and I fell off the table... it hurt!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Wow, I didn't
know Jenna had the power to push people off tables with her voice.
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ..........
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 4! What
do you look for in a girl?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> They must
not tease me about cats or set fire to my cape or anything.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> o_O;;; Who set
fire to your cape?!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Garet...
Jenna... Saturos... Menardi... Agatio... Karst...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> o_O;;; Question
5... you had a green cape in Golden Sun, then a blue one in the Lost Age,
save for character art in which its always the green cape. Whatever happened
to the green cape ingame?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I just
keep my capes in my many pockets... and change them at random... I just
favoured the blue cape for a long while...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ah yes, speaking
of pockets... you have many pockets... whats the deal with pockets?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... I like
pockets. Pockets are cool. I can keep things in them. How Karst managed
to find the right pocket to get the Mars Star out of, I'll never know.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ... She saw you
pocketing it shortly after taking it from Isaac!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Oh, of
course...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 6! Who
do you loathe?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Alex! He
constantly flirts with and pisses off my sister, and he insulted me in
Champa along with everybody else! Plus he thinks he looks so hot with his
stupid long blue hair, but all it does is make him look like a girl! Oh,
and he tried to rule the world!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 7...
ever wanted to kill Kraden?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hasn't
everybody?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> o_O' Um... Question
8... what was the deal with calling Isaac 'boy' in the inn when he's only
a year younger than you?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, I
couldn't call him Isaac... and 'man' just sounds... weird!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hmm... You, Man,
what business do you have with me? *giggles*
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> It was
actually 'do you have any business with me?' The point was that it was
a closed question...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Talk about picky...
Question 9! What do you think your best qualities are?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Well, I
don't let anybody get themselves killed, I always defend myself to the
last minute and stick up for what I think is right, even if it means defying
super powerful Mars Adepts... and I don't let myself get killed either!
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> That's funny...
I was about to ask if you had suicidal tendencies... on the Jupiter Lighthouse
aerie, you smiled when Karst and Agatio threatened you... okay, so they
had just said your parents would be fine, but whats so great about the
prospect of being murdered?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I care
for my family! Is that a problem?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> My problem is
that I dont want you getting yourself killed because if you did, you'd
be in big trouble!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Is that
all the questions?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Question 10,
last question! Why didn't you just punch the Alhafran Mayor in the ugly,
fat face?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Because
then I would be acting out of character.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> -_-;;; But would
you do it if he tried to hit on Jenna?
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> You're
giving me bad images...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Just answer the
question!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Of course!
Anybody who hits on Jenna is asking for it *cough* I mean... certain types
of people... yeah...
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> ^_^;;; Thank
you very much for the interview... now we're going to see what other people
say about Felix!
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> My brother
is way too overprotective! I think he needs a lesson...
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He's got
the looks! Felix is so hot!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix
is... pretty strange...
<br><img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> He's a
bit of a mystery but once you get to know him, it's fine!
<br><img src="../../icons/garet.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix is
very scary, he's always threatening me...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix is
Felix, that's all I can really say about him.
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> So long as
Felix hates Alex too, he's OK in my book!
<br><img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_father.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
Well, I'm proud of Felix... robbing his own hometown and getting away unscathed
is surely something to be proud of...
<br><img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_mother.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
I do worry about Felix a lot, he's always jumping off high places and I'm
afraid he will hurt himself.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyle.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ashamedly,
I took more notice of Felix than my own son on the aerie of Mars Lighthouse,
I'm not sure why...
<br><img src="../../icons/dora.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Ah yes,
Felix... he's terribly surprising... just when you think he's dead, he
isn't...
<br><img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I want
to be strong like Felix... oh, and Garet and Isaac too!
<br><img src="../../icons/kay.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix? Oh
yes, the one who threatens Garet. Good on you, Felix, you learn fast.
<br><img src="../../icons/mrjerra.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Is Felix
Garet's friend who came back after three years? Oh yes, Garet loved his
mother's cookies...
<br><img src="../../icons/mrsjerra.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Seems
like only yesterday those boys were breaking everything, oh yes, and Jenna
tagging along after them... ah, the good old days...
<br><img src="../../icons/the_mayor.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix
is quite famous for robbing Vale and then sinking it by lighting Mars Lighthouse,
but if he saved the world, that's fine.
<br><img src="../../icons/garets_grandmother.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32">
Felix is like almost everything Garet is not... but then he does have some
things in common with my grandson as well...
<br><img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix
is a very resourceful person, goodness knows what he keeps in all those
pockets.
<br><img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix
had a terrible burden, one I wouldn't wish on any man, but it's gone now,
thank goodness...
<br><img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Im sure
Felix looks a bit like Isaac, but everybody disagrees with me...
<br><img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix
is a very good boy, even jumping down after our Wind Adept... that's gotta
take guts.
<br><img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I always
did like Felix better than that weirdo Alex...
<br><img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Hmph...
Felix is very annoying...
<br><img src="../../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> I always
thought Felix was a slowcoach myself... took far too long to light the
lighthouses...
<br><img src="../../icons/alex.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> Felix is
pathetic, his hair is not as great as mine, so his statement is completely
unfounded because I, Alex, say so.
