<p align="center">Sunshine's Interview</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Okay, do you understand why you are here?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am... 
being interviewed for some site? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's right. 
Question one: State your name and occupation for the benefit of those who don't 
bother to remember minor characters. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am 
Sunshine, the blacksmith in Yallam. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right... um... 
Question two: Why don't you forge Excaliburs more often?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What do 
you mean? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> People would 
probably like it if you turned their Orihalcons into Excaliburs. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really, 
now? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're doing it on 
purpose, aren't you? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep... 
I... er, don't know what you're talking about! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure you don't. 
Question three: Did Yepp ever write any songs about you? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's... 
a random question. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. He could 
totally have written something like "You are my Sunshine" <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is that 
actually a song?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *smirk* Yes.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ...&nbsp; 
Why am I here again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four: 
Were your parents on pot? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm here 
to be made fun of, aren't I? ._. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who the hell would 
name their son Sunshine? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; 
Everybody makes fun of me! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, probably 
because your name's Sunshine. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *cries* 
It's not my fault ;_; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; Question 
five: Is it really safe for you to be forging weapons?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> T_____T I 
don't want to answer anymore... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I mean, what if 
you were forging an axe, someone teased you about your name and you just 
snapped? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is 
wrong with you? ;_____; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can just see the 
headline now. "Psychotic Blacksmith no longer has a sunny temperament as he 
charges through Yallam with axe" <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; I 
want to leave... T__________T<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But then again, 
you'd probably just sit on your lazy ass and decide to wait until it rains 
before going on a serial killing spree, then never do it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You have 
a weird imagination...&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question six: Why 
don't you just change your name then? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... I 
can do that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Question 
seven: Do you ever... DO anything? You're always lying down! <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't 
go and collect materials when it's raining. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> THAT'S your 
excuse? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_- Question 
eight: Do you have a sibling called Moonlight? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm an 
only child. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. Okay then. 
Question nine:&nbsp; Do you like your eggs sunny side up?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... 
... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? You're 
giving me the silent treatment now? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Geez, you're no 
fun at all. Question ten: Isn't it kind of ironic you like going out in the rain 
when your name's Sunshine? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sunshine.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... It's 
easier to collect materials from the swamp.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course. Anyway, 
you can go now. Let's see what everyone thinks about Sunshine.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor guy. He 
was doomed from birth.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *snicker* 
Sunshine... haha. That's funny.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh, I dunno. 
You kind of get used to it after a while.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why tease him 
for it? It's not really his fault.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sunshine had 
some cruel parents.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I still 
don't understand why someone would name their son Sunshine.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now I have 
weird images of Yepp singing "You are my Sunshine" to him... and I don't even 
know what Yepp looked or sounded like!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sometimes I 
get teased about my name too... ._. Both of them.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sunshine? 
That's just ridiculous.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I'm 
Proxian. Strange names sound normal to me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Same here.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *shrug* So 
he's named after sunlight. Whatever.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
care about this Sunshine person.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just what 
were his parents thinking?<br>
