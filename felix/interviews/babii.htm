<p align="center">Babi's Interview</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Let me get one thing straight. Nobody likes you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm glad you died, 
by the way. <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question One: How 
old exactly are you again? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A hundred and 
fifty... maybe. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jeez... you lived 
for way too long. Question two: If Lemuria sued you for stealing their lucky 
medal fountain, how would you plead? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I thought it 
was cool.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. Question 
three: Why do you even exist? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To give Isaac 
and co. the mission to go to Lemuria?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Which they never 
did because of Poseidon. If you go after getting them? NOTHING HAPPENS.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Dumb writers. 
Question four: Are you just a lazy bastard who couldn't be bothered to go to 
Lemuria yourself to get more draught before you got too old?<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You want me 
to say yes? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question five: Did 
Alex kill you? Because I'll like him even more if he did. <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Who is 
this Alex? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A guy who could be 
so insanely evil we all hate him, but he would still be a better person than 
you. <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why am I even 
being interviewed? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I'm bored 
and people want me to update. Question six: Why did you want Isaac to fight 
alone in Colosso? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... well...&nbsp;
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is it because you 
only wanted him alone to get all sweaty and worked up? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isn't that 
two questions? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's my site. I 
can do what I like. <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nobody gives 
a crap about his friends anyway.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Just like 
those pirates in Alhafra... sheesh. Question seven: Okay, why did you kidnap 
Sheba?<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To force 
people in Lalivero to build my lighthouse of course. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So you had to 
force them by capturing a fourteen year old girl? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. What's 
wrong with that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Gee, I don't know. 
It's not like there were other options. <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She is their 
Holy Child. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure, whatever. 
Pedobear says hi by the way. Question eight: Why the hell don't Isaac and co. 
see anything wrong with you kidnapping a young girl? <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are you 
asking me? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know. It 
seems lame they are so willing to help a kidnapper of young girls forcing people 
to build a lighthouse.<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So go bother 
them then!&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question nine: Is 
it time I ended this interview?<br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I usually ask ten, 
but nine is close enough. <br>
<img src="../../icons/babi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... *is dead 
again* <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now let's see what 
people think of Babi...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... 
well... Babi was a nice person! ... He was nice to us... ... okay, I have 
nothing.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wanted to 
fight in Colosso... ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, why 
were we trying to help Sheba's kidnapper again?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I bet Alex was 
the one who killed him because Alex is EVIL!&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyone who 
kidnaps Sheba deserves to be punished... <br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor Sheba, 
being kidnapped by that creep... <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *shudder* 
Babi was evil... <br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I hate Babi. 
All of Lemuria hates him for being a thief.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have better 
things to do than killing people who are about to DIE ANYWAY<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
care about Babi.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was 
really nice of him to let her go though. Made things much easier. <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Should I 
know the guy? <br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. Just 
some lame old guy who's dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/iodem.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Babi... ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/lunpa.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kidnapping 
young girls? Really now! That's just obscene!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I liked 
Babi... ;_;<br>
