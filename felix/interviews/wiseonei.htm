<p align="center">Wise One's Interview</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Our next interview is with the one-eyed talking rock!<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's the 
Wise One! Not one-eyed talking rock! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you look 
like a one-eyed talking rock. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would 
rather not be referred to as a one-eyed talking rock. I am Vale's protector. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question One: If 
you had a nose, would it be particularly long? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have no 
need for a nose, and why would it be long? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, because you 
seem to like telling lies. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Lying can 
make your nose grow? I did not know that. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Not usually.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Forget it. 
Question two: Do you admit to being a pathological liar? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You seem 
to be rather fixated on my lying. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> "Lighting the 
lighthouses will destroy the world", my ASS! <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The wars 
that resulted from unleashing Alchemy could. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No excuses! <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I 
simply thought the world eroding away would be better. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: 
Why do you want everyone to die? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Does it 
appear to be that way? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You'd rather have 
the way that will destroy the world one hundred percent, rather than the one 
with maybe fifty percent chance? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, that 
is correct. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't get you at 
all. Question four: What is your favourite food? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Excuse 
me? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, do you not eat 
food? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have no 
mouth.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But then you don't 
even get to eat delicious food. Like cheese, for instance. Doesn't that suck?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do not 
even need to eat. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question five: Is 
it possible for you to have feelings toward a human? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What kind 
of feelings are you talking about? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You know, romantic 
feelings. Like you want to jump into the sack with someone. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am 
incapable of such feelings. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah right. You 
just don't want to admit anything because you are a rock. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's 
just it. I have the appearance of a rock, therefore dating a human would be 
quite strange. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Love knows no 
bounds! Question six: Do you have a gender? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A gender? 
That determines if one is male or female, doesn't it? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, yes... <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
have no gender, so I am neither male or female. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. Question 
seven: What are your favourite activities? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Guarding 
Mt. Aleph, or, well, that used to be... and rolling in grassy fields. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You forgot lying 
to people and sending them off on world destroying quests. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Well, 
they chose for themselves in the end. I guess they really did want to save the 
world.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's better than 
falling into the great abyss and dying. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose 
that is true. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: 
Why did you abandon Alex to die on top of a sinking mountain when he was injured 
and paralysed? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I felt 
like it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So much for not 
being actually evil. You left him to die. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I'm 
sure an annoying and arrogant person like him can find a way out of it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Doesn't change the 
fact it was a situation which he could easily die and it's known you can 
teleport people elsewhere.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who 
cares? Alex is obviously annoying scum anyway.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're a jerk. 
Question nine: Why did you feel it necessary to kill Agatio and Karst? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I turned 
them into dragons. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, and then that 
meant their deaths. I don't think they even had time to wait for the beacon to 
be lit before dying, plus they vanish when leaving the room. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, the 
Proxians deserved it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are an evil 
rock. Whatever did the Proxians do to deserve such cruel treatment? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Tried to 
unleash Alchemy.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I bet you just 
don't like them because of their red eyes and pointy ears! They are human 
beings!<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Human 
beings I don't particularly like.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten: How 
can I get Camelot to make it possible to fight and kill you in the next Golden 
Sun game? <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why would 
I even know something like that? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If you were the 
ultimate boss and I could kick your ass permanently, that would be great. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have no 
weaknesses. At least, I think. And Alex got pulverised with part of Alchemy. 
Nobody can match me. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We'll see about 
that, Rocky. <br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My name 
is not Rocky. It is the Wise One. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Now what 
does everyone think of the Wise One? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He has a 
sick sense of humour.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Tried to 
make us destroy the world or something. What's his problem?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The Wise One 
is very complex...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why is he so 
cruel to the poor Proxians? What an awful rock.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A talking 
one-eyed rock that can beat anyone up and delay eruptions is rather scary...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want to 
burn him, but I'm afraid I'll get beaten up...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The Wise One 
is a freak.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Does he 
want the world destroyed or doesn't he? I'm still confused.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why is 
everyone unable to understand the Wise One simply wanted to be sure they were 
strong enough to protect Weyard? That was the point of that test, wasn't it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That evil 
rock stopped me from accomplishing my goals.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Though 
it may not seem like it, the Wise One is really a kind being...<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's 
such a thing as a one-eyed, talking rock? Really?<br>
<img src="../../icons/the_mayor.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is 
Vale's great protector!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garets_grandmother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Many of us Valeans look up to the Wise One.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Complaining about the Wise One himself? For shame!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mrsjerra.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> All hail 
the Wise One!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kay.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Didn't he save 
us? Why is everyone complaining?<br>
<img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A one-eyed 
talking rock! Cool!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_father.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Is there a reason why he didn't stop that big boulder from coming down three 
years ago?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felixs_jennas_mother.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
He turned us into a dragon? I don't really remember that part.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyle.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't think 
I want to be turned into a dragon again...<br>
<img src="../../icons/dora.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I actually 
saw the Wise One. It was awesome.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Scared the 
hell out of me in Sol Sanctum.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He killed 
my sister and Agatio! The slimeball!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He turned me 
into a dragon and I died. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Damn rock. 
It's his fault Karst and I are dead.</p>
