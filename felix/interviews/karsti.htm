<p align="center">Karst's Interview<</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
It's time for your interview...<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really?! 
It's about time! Why did it take so long?! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... well... er... 
so, let's get on with the questions, shall we? ^_^; <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't change 
the subject on me! I want answers! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So do I. Question 
one: Are you close to your sister? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, yes. 
Very. I look up to her. I want to be as great and awesome as my older sister.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right...<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I even have 
a scythe too! And I spelled my attack right! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question two: What 
is your relationship with Agatio? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We are 
merely partners, that's all. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? You were 
never... lovers? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No! Of 
course not! He's ugly! He's not at all handsome... like Saturos... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: So 
you find Saturos handsome too?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, he is a 
smouldering, sexy beast. Sadly, my sister got to him first. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question four: Who 
would you consider a good alternative then? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
think Felix's hot... but I'm still kind of mad at him... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> For saving Isaac?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. That 
backstabbing traitor. Gah. And I was about to avenge my dear sister too!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question five: Is 
it really fair to hate Isaac so much? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He killed my 
sister! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos and 
Menardi turned into a two headed dragon and attacked him though.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, I'm 
only going on what that girl told me. "Isaac killed them", she said. Just like 
that! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is revenge really 
so great? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes! I have 
to avenge my sister's death! Isaac, I swear to kill you one day! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> People don't want 
you killing Isaac though. <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Screw them.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Question 
six: Why did you fight Ivan instead of Isaac? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... 
well... I was confused. Yeah. That's it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?!&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, they 
are both blonde! And... er... that's where the similarity ends, isn't it? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It really doesn't 
make much sense. <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Deal with 
it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: 
Where did your bodies go? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... you 
mean, Agatio and I? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> After the dragon 
fight, leaving the room and coming back, your bodies just vanish! <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... 
well... maybe we really did just disappear.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Camelot has no 
love for the 'antagonists'... make them vanish as soon as they no longer have a 
purpose.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who else 
'vanished'?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex, kind of. We 
don't know what happened to him. <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I hope he 
got a painful death, the little snot... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: 
So, you don't like Alex either? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heck, no! He 
was a smug little bastard, always smirking all the time, and so full of himself!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose Alex 
could be a bit annoying at times... <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> AND EVIL! 
PURE EVIL!&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... *headdesk*&nbsp;
<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'd love to 
decapitate him and watch his head bounce on the floor. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ok, let's leave 
that for the Torture Chamber... Question nine: What is your greatest weakness?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm... I 
think I get enraged a little easily... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you are a 
Mars Adept. <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> People have 
to watch what they say around me. Otherwise... *strokes scythe* <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You really like 
that, don't you? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Scythes are 
kickass. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question ten: How 
did you get into Jupiter Lighthouse anyway?&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Very 
carefully. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... Really?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or that 
bastard Alex warped us. I don't know. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, that again. It 
must be hard to get through Jupiter Lighthouse without... I dunno, Hover or 
Whirlwind? <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex warping 
negates all those problems.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He really is a 
deus ex machina... <br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> An annoying 
one too. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's see what 
everyone thinks about Karst!&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *whimper* 
She still wants to kill me? ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I won't let 
her kill Isaac!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's... 
really scary... especially with that scythe...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think she's 
worse than Menardi, temper wise.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Kind of 
cute, but scary.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is her 
problem anyway? She should take Valium or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I learned an 
important lesson. Don't provoke a Mars Adept.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That skirt 
is so short, I can't stop staring at it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm... she 
is rather cute... heh heh...<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My little 
sister is adorable.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's too 
young for me. And I have Menardi.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Karst is a 
very skilled warrior indeed.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She is 
quite passionate...<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What are 
you asking me for?</p>
