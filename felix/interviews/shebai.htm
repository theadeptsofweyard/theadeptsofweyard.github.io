<p align="center">Sheba's Interview</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Hi! It's time for your interview.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes... I 
foresaw it coming up. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Right. Ready?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course! 
I've been looking forward to this! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question 1: Why 
did you tease Jenna about Isaac in Madra? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Enthusiasm... fading... I need to answer a call of nature. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! Answer the 
question! <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw, man...&nbsp; 
okay, okay. It was a diabolical plot, I admit it!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A diabolical 
plot?! <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes! It 
irked me how Mudshipping was so common and everyone and their dog was a 
Mudshipper so... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You thought you'd 
shatter their faith and turn people into Valeshippers? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pretty much, 
yes. Technically, it was Camelot's diabolical plot. They wrote the script. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question two: Are 
you responsible for the atrocity that is your hair?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; What's 
wrong with my hair? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's shaped like a 
melon! Or a potato! Or a... salad bowl. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, my 
stylist's sight isn't so good... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So your stylist is 
to blame, then? Question three: Are you an alien? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Falling from 
the sky makes me an alien? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Common consensus 
is that you came from the moon. That makes you an alien. Hah! <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The moon 
came from Weyard's surface though! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Yeah, well. 
You're still an alien. Question four: Who faints more, you or Ivan? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; It isn't 
nice to make fun of us for fainting all the time. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh believe me, we 
don't find it fun. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We don't 
keep track or anything. We're just aware we both faint a lot. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32">&nbsp; Question 
five: Do you enjoy being worshipped?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh 
certainly. I love making the people of Lalivero bow to me! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Fascinating. I 
hope you don't abuse your... power. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Being a 
Goddess does have perks. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Whoah. Easy. 
o_o;;; <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? 
Goddess Sheba has a nice ring to it. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are<i> not</i> 
a deity!<i> </i><br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I may well 
be to Lalivero. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Question 
six: Will you ever find out your darn past? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Depends on 
if Camelot wants it to be so. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's so annoying 
that the only hint is some old guy's mind. They should let you find out for 
real. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, 
well... I don't see a sequel yet. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question seven: 
How did you feel when you heard of Lord Babi's death? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, we 
were a bit irked at Alex for telling that to us out of the blue. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I sincerely hope 
you weren't upset. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course 
not! The old boob kidnapped me! If anything, I would have been happy. He can't 
kidnap me again. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'd like to see 
Tolbi come after you again and eat Spark Plasmas. &gt;_&gt; <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They won't 
be building Babi Lighthouse anymore... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, but they may 
want Lalivero to obey them again. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh... 
Tolbi's evil. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: 
Would you date Picard? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> &gt;_&gt; That 
ending cartoon doesn't mean a thing. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But would you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
know... apparently he looks my age, but I must have forgotten how old I am or 
something, because... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Picard doesn't 
look fourteen? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, yeah. 
If I forget the fact he's probably sixty... it doesn't seem so bad. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Picard is hot for 
an old guy. Question nine: Do you have something against Isaac? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... why?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, just that you 
were quick to tell a certain hotheaded Mars Adept Isaac killed her sister. <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er... well, 
I just thought she ought to know... yeah... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you feel 
remorse when she ran off swearing to kill Isaac? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not really. 
I didn't really know him at the time after all... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're cold. 
Question ten: Will you ever find out Picard's age? <br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I've tried 
everything. Read his mind while he was asleep, got him distracted and read his 
mind... nothing works. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Gee, that's a 
shame. Now what does everyone think of Sheba? <br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Blabbermouthing rat. &gt;_&gt;<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She teased 
me when I was crying. I don't like her. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba and I 
enjoy plotting evil together. But don't tell anyone.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba seems 
quite nice, but there's something about her...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba's kind 
of cute. There's nothing wrong with her hair.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba is 
irritating and a tease!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish she 
would leave my age alone.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do not care 
much for her. I consider her to be an irritant.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba is a 
little noisy, almost like Jenna.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This girl 
better stay away from Isaac too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I feel 
sorry for Sheba, not getting to find out her past...<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I knew she 
was a Wind Adept. She had that annoying and devious quality about her.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I liked 
the fact Sheba kept quiet. Unlike Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sheba 
stupid! Sheba come make the party complete at Jupiter Lighthouse!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just love 
how she immediately tells me who I must go and kill.</p>
