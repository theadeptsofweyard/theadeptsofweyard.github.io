And now it's time for an interview with Mia!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hi, everybody!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now, Mia, you have 
to answer my questions. Ok? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm ready.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question one: Why 
do you think Alex is evil? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because he is.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... So in other 
words, you're just guessing? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He betrayed my 
clan! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Your clan was 
totally into the whole 'Let's let Gaia Falls eat Weyard!' thing, huh? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, we didn't 
know! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> &gt;_&gt; Yeah... how 
did Alex find out anyway? Oh well... Question two: Are you naturally 
blue-haired? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... yes. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not hair dye, huh?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It most 
certainly is not. ._. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question three: 
Why do you wear those thick robes all the time? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I am 
from Imil. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't you get hot?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> All the time.
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... You must have 
had a hell of a time in the Lamakan Desert. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do suppose 
it was a little stuffy in that place. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ... 
Question four: Was it difficult travelling with three guys? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How do you 
mean? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nobody ever tried 
to peek at you or anything? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, no, Isaac 
and Ivan don't do that. I think Garet may have tried once or twice. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They probably 
learned not to annoy you...&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, anybody 
who annoys me gets hurt. Badly. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yikes. Question 
five: Did that look in the ending cartoon mean anything? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? Looking 
at Garet? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Some crazy 
people think it hints at Steamshipping. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So Garet and I 
aren't allowed to look at each other without it being romantic? That makes no 
sense! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sad, isn't it? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course it 
didn't mean anything. We were two friends celebrating together, we weren't going 
to be looking at the ground the whole time. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Exactly. It's not 
like everyone was looking at the person they were madly in love with. Because 
then there would be some very weird- <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't you 
move on to the next question? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question six: Do 
you prefer staves or maces? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maces of 
course! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh huh, they 
are all spiky, and you can hit people really hard with them. It's fun. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're scary. 
Question seven: How does it feel to be Isaac's first word?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, well, you 
see, Isaac already spoke. You just don't see it in the game. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose, but 
your name was the first word he said that we could see. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess it 
was. And Mudshippers seized on that, didn't they? <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, Isaac did 
choose to yell your name rather than that of his childhood friend, who also 
happened to be his best friend. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose it 
does seem a little odd when you put it like that. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe Isaac likes 
you. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... sure...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question eight: 
Are you a snowball champion?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I was a bit 
too busy healing people to be throwing snowballs.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Snowballs are fun. 
I like snow. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I get snow all 
the time... <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Question nine: 
What's your worst fear? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know. 
Maybe the Mercury Lighthouse fountain stops working when I'm not in Imil. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... You're allowed 
to stop thinking about the Imilians, you know. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I spent 
most of my life looking after those people! It's not my fault they control me!
<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Just say 
no. <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But that's 
mean! <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> -_-; Question ten: 
Where did the Mercury Clan go? <br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose they 
all died. <br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just like that?
<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just like 
that.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Well, thanks 
for your time. Now what does everyone think about Mia?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia's 
alright, but a little scary sometimes.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm scared 
she might kill me because I annoy her. ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia's a very 
kind and nice girl, but she does have a violent streak underneath...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's 
pretty, but I'm a little scared of her.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How can she 
say such mean things about my dear Alex?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like Mia, 
for the fact she joined in with teasing Garet...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I find Mia 
to be a wildly unpredictable person.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia is mean. 
She hates my guts for no good reason.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mia is a 
very beautiful and kind girl. Why is everyone being so negative?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I want her 
to stay away from MY Isaac.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She 
doesn't seem that intelligent. Did she really ask Layana if those doubloons were 
golden? What else would they have been, chocolate?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Scary. 
Uses Mercury Psynergy. Water bad for Saturos.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Irritating. And not beautiful at all. I'M the beautiful one.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Am I a big 
coward because I couldn't even face fighting her?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Dropping her 
into that trap was fun.<br>
