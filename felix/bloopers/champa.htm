<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, how 
terrible. Look what happened now that we let that pirate escape.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know. All 
the people who were supposed to be starving and miserable are now well fed.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We haven't 
actually been here yet...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We haven't? 
Why not?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So that 
this can happen!<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
IIIIIIIIISAAAAAAAAAC!!! *cannonballs through Champa and crashes into Felix, 
wrapping her arms around him*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Help me! 
*flails* ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Wow, 
that's random. Who is the screaming girl clinging to you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait a 
minute, you are not Isaac, are you? *lets go*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Does this 
Isaac look particularly like Felix?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No. -_- She 
must have sight problems.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniff* I 
am sorry... I just wanted to see Isaac... and...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ok, here's a 
pop quiz. What is Isaac's eye colour?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *thinks* 
Um... er... oh! I know! Gray! It is gray, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* And 
his hair colour?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... it 
was dark, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who is this 
girl?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And how long 
is Isaac's hair?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Shoulder-length?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't 
even remember what he looks like, do you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's stop 
teasing her. Are you looking for Isaac?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, old 
man! My name is Feizhi and I am looking for Isaac so I can confess my love for 
him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Seriously?<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish to 
marry him and bear his children.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... uh, 
if we see him, we'll let him know...<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, and 
could you give him this ring I made? *hands over ring*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course. 
We'll give this to him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thank you 
very much. I must go now. *leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, who's 
forgotten about the ring already?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hm? What 
ring are you talking about?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Weren't we 
asked to do something with a ring... no, I must be imagining things.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's turn 
around now and try to leave so that we can get to the next cutscene!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow. 
Clearly, we have short memory problems.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, hello, 
everybody! What a coincidence to find you all here!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex! Why 
are you here?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, I was 
lying in wait so that I could have fun threatening you all.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Threatening... us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> In a minute! 
But first... my, my, have I been replaced already?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Serves you 
right for leaving us for dead on Idejima, you jerk.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, who is 
this guy?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A total 
pain in the ass who used to travel with us. I'm so glad he left us.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. He 
does look very annoying.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have 
already been replaced by an amateur Water Adept... well, he isn't as beautiful 
as me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Beautiful?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am so much 
more handsome and sexy and-<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers is 
better than you are. Deal with it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah! We 
don't want to kill him for starters.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... 
thanks?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please go 
crawl in a hole and die, Alex.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aren't you a 
bitter bunch? And I was just trying to help you with your task.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We don't 
need your help, Alex. We can do just fine without you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O RLY?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah! It's the 
crazy psycho who wants to kill Isaac after I told on him!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And why did 
you even think it was a good idea to tell her who killed her sister?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My name is 
Karst, not crazy psycho! And I see you remember me...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
hanging out with her or something, Alex?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe I am. 
Is that a problem?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't 
forget about me!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, there's 
another pointy-eared, red-eyed person around, I see.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't 
know who he is?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He was busy 
buying candies and stuff when I met them in Madra.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like 
candy!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We know, 
Agatio...<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, who are 
these people? I'm going to play guessing games. The old man must be that 
rambling old fart, Kraden.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! I'm 
not a rambling old fart... ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That must 
be Sheba. You're right, Alex, she does have a huge melon-shaped head.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex, you 
jerk! And you're a jerk too!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You really 
need a new stylist. Maybe I can recommend my stylist?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; How 
mean...<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The one 
with the ponytail's gotta be Felix. Then that would be Jenna. Wow, they really 
do look like an unreliable bunch of ragamuffins.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed, they 
are rather useless, so I had to abandon them of course. I may have been hasty in 
my judgment though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is such a 
jerk.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know. Ugh.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... 
Piers... your Japanese name is Picard, 
right? Were your parents Trekkies?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... No. And 
if you start making Star Trek jokes, I will make you suffer.<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Psh. You are 
just an amateur. Anyway, I was thinking of borrowing your ship at one point.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's 
stealing!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I figured 
I could find something better than that piece of junk, so I decided not to.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piece of 
junk? Are you calling my ship a piece of junk?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did I call it 
a ship? Sorry. I meant a boat.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's a 
difference?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is just 
spewing bullshit as usual.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't we 
just ignore him?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are 
dead meat.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Enough of 
this! Alex, what makes these punks useful?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, because 
they managed to get a shiny orb back from Kibombo. I think.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're 
getting tired of waiting for you to light the lighthouses.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So if you 
don't hurry up, we might just try to do it ourselves.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. All 
we'd need is the melon head and the Jupiter Star.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't call 
me Melon Head!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't worry. 
I'm opposed to their drastic way of thinking. I just wanted to use them to 
threaten you into working faster.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What he 
said. So, you'd better hurry.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow. 
Impatient, much?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, we 
are, and we're proud of it too! *leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... 
beware. *also leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hope to see 
you guys near Jupiter Lighthouse soon. ^_^ *walks past* Oh... wait.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What now, 
Alex? Can't you just leave already?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, Kraden, 
you are doing this quest on behalf of Lord Babi?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Why?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, because 
he died not long ago.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's dead?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Dead as a 
doornail.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> YES! 
YEEEEESSSS! ^_^ *punches the air*<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No..... 
NOOOOOOOOOOO! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why is 
Sheba cheering?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because the 
buttmunch kidnapped her and held her hostage for a while.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That Babi. 
What a creep.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sobs 
hysterically*<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Anyway, 
you should stay away from Gondowan. They may think we had a hand in it or 
something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you 
have something to do with it? How would you know such a thing?<br>
<img src="../../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No! I didn't 
do anything! I just happen to know for some reason. Anyway, I must go. *leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thank 
goodness. He's finally gone.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *weeps*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh! Quit 
crying about it, Kraden! Babi was an evil asshole!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, 
Kraden, he held Sheba hostage, remember?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. Yes. I 
had forgotten. Now where were we?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is such 
a jackass! Coming here just to threaten us... I want to maim him so much... ugh. 
And set him on fire.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What was the 
point of telling us about Babi anyway?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
Alex had a reason for telling Kraden. It means Kraden doesn't have to do it for 
Babi anymore, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, my 
reasons have changed actually... I now do it because of what I learned on this 
quest and not just for research.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Research?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What you 
learned on the quest?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course 
not. I've only spoken to Felix about this.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
TELL US, FELIX. &gt;=E<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep. *hides 
behind Piers*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
think he wants to.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now is not 
the time to tell you. It's too complicated. I'll tell you when we get to 
Lemuria, so wait.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You had 
better tell us then.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's a 
promise, alright?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, I 
promise. Piers, you don't mind waiting?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have an 
idea of what you are talking about, so it's fine. Now why don't we end this 
ridiculously long cutscene and go get that Trident?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, let's 
do that...</p>
