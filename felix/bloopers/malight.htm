<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Looks like 
we're finally at the Mars Lighthouse Aerie...<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
BETRAYERS!!! You have arrived!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Waaaaaaaauuuuuuugh! *has heart attack and seizure, collapses*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, it's 
that lying scum of a one-eyed rock who told us we were supposedly saving the 
world by preventing Alchemy's unleashing.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-what 
did you say?! I expressly said lighting the lighthouses would lead to the 
world's destruction!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, and 
you lied to us, you jerk!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... a 
talking one-eyed rock? ... I'm not tripping, am I?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe we 
shouldn't have eaten that weird stuff we found stashed away in that closet in 
those bags.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Y-you found 
my secret drug stash?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, they were 
drugs? I thought they were brown sugar or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Except 
eating brown sugar has never felt as good. Man, I thought that talking dog with 
the red eyes was weird...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But this... 
we're talking to a one-eyed rock!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Are they 
completely unaware we can see the rock too?<br>
<img src="../../icons/kraden.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm... 
dying... save...... me....... ple..... *faints*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow, look at 
that! The Wise One managed to shut KRADEN up!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix, why 
don't you hurry up and light the lighthouse? That rock scares me...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Y-yeah, I 
was just about to... *moves towards beacon*<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *pushes 
Felix back with energy* YOU. SHALL NOT. PASS!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But we're 
trying to save the world!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I see. The 
Wise One is evil. Under these circumstances, it is clear we must fight him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, 
what?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We must light 
the lighthouses or Gaia Falls will erode Weyard completely!<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You have 
all learned far too much.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. I 
learned far too much the time I saw Kraden naked by accident.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That 
actually sounds funny when I'm high...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, don't 
go sharing such information with us!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are we going 
to have to fight the scary looking rock then?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Looks like 
we have no choice. It doesn't want us to save the world.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait a 
minute! Now guess who has also learned far too much and is ascending Mt. Aleph 
to steal Alchemy? He knows a lot more than any of you do. He knows that the 
Golden Sun will form-<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So <i>that's
</i>where the game's name comes from!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet! No 
breaking the fourth wall!<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ahem. He 
knows it will form on top of Mt. Aleph when all four beacons are lit and the 
Stone of Stages will appear.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You've told 
us it's a he already.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
care! Go ahead and guess!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's probably 
that bastard Alex. He's evil! EEEEEVIIIILLLLL!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is not! 
He may be a bit annoying, but he is sexy, charming, and aloof in a sexy way... 
and that hair! There's no way he is evil-<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Correct, 
Mia.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... PROVE 
IT.<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can we just 
save the world already?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's no 
way it's Alex, you lying rock! He is handsome, suave and would absolutely never 
try to steal Alchemy, you piece of-<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sorry, it 
must be the other guy named Alex with long, blue hair who wears purple clothes 
then.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* Can we 
please get the lighthouse lit now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, 
because I'm summoning a three-headed dragon. Have fun. *disappears*<br>

ROAR!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are you 
using the parents' face icons?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I can.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You mean you 
are too lazy to find and use the Doom Dragon sprite.<br>
<img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> SCREW YOU. 
*leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Guys, this 
is it! The final battle! Let's try and do this without screwing it up.<br>

Blargh. *all almost dead*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The Wise One 
really is evil.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... This 
is... ridiculous...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; MOM! 
DAD! NOOOOO!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I knew what 
I was doing the moment I raised my sword.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's it?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac, your 
father is lying there almost dead and that's all you can say? You haven't even 
seen him in three years, those which you thought him actually dead!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is wrong 
with you, Isaac?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That Wise 
One, he is evil incarnate. How could he do this to everyone? Has he no idea of 
the damage done to someone who kills their own parents?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How 
terrible... for them to lose their parents like this... ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
;___________________;<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am a 
robot.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I cannot 
feel any emotion. I cannot get angry, or laugh, or cry... I can't even... 
love...<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But... but... 
*teary eyes* I love you, Isaac. Does that mean... you can't even return my 
feelings? *kisses him passionately*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I really hope 
this is just a weird drug trip...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No. I felt 
nothing just now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then... 
then... there is no point... to... living... *commits seppuku*<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> For crying 
out loud! What are you...?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ...! No... 
Mia... Mia! *cradles her* Mia... why?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't go 
on... without your love... *dies*<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No... 
Miaaaaaaa! *tear falls, head crackles and suddenly explodes, then melts*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess he 
really was a robot then.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, only a 
robot would seem absolutely incapable of crying over the dying father they had 
lost for three years.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *lights 
lighthouse* I'm sick of listening to all this rubbish.<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! 
Check this out! I'm talking to you all from far away!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh great, 
now the drugs are making me hear voices in my head.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hama... 
sister... hey, why did the spelling of your name change anyway?<br>
<img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
know! Uh, oh yeah, it's dangerous and stuff so get away as soon as you can. The 
Wise One told me it would be very dangerous.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh? The Wise 
One is saying that stuff? I thought he was evil or something.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Looks like 
we'd better get out of here... Heck of a lot of bodies to drag back though...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We could 
just drop them down the lighthouse and pick them up down there?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... let's 
just carry them back somehow...</p>
<p align="left">*Everyone somehow returns to Prox, chats a bit then prepares to 
leave*</p>

alive!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know 
whether to be happy my parents are alive or sad that Kraden isn't dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No... Isaac is 
still dead because he was a robot after all and I'm alive. THIS SUCKS.<br>

both Dora and Isaac are robots? o_o<br>
