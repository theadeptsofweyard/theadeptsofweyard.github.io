<img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> Hmm... I wonder...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Looks like Kraden has 
got something on his mind.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Well, don't keep us in 
suspense. Tell us!<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> 
Oh, you really wish to hear the silly whimsies of an old man?<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> But of course we're 
always happy to hear you speak.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Always...?<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Come on, he does at least 
have interesting things to say...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Yeah, well, you didn't 
have to sit through his lessons...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Pipe down, Garet...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Meh, go ahead. Give me 
something to take my mind off sailing.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> What if parallel 
worlds existed?<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> I 
gotta admit, that was not what I was expecting to hear...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Um... what exactly do 
you mean, Kraden?<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> 
Worlds like this one, where things, people, events are different...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Like a world with a 
smart Garet?<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Hey!<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Or an Alex who didn't 
betray our clan...<br><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Maybe a world where I didn't believe my family dead for three years...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Jenna...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> There could be a world 
where I'm with my family? I mean, I'm happy to be with you all and I'm grateful 
to everyone in Lalivero too, but the not knowing...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> It's alright, Sheba, 
it's perfectly understandable.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32"> Oh dear, it seems I've 
given rise to some sad thoughts. My apologies...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> No need for that, 
Kraden, we asked after all. <br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Still, it's strange to 
think what could happen in alternate worlds... how people could turn out... how 
differently events could go...<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> So many possibilities. 
Not that we'll ever know, I suppose...<br></p>
