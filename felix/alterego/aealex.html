<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh oh... I'm in a scary place yet again... NO! NOOOOO!</p>
<p>*Alex curls up on the floor, whimpering in fear, believing he is about to 
suffer yet another torture*</p>
<p>Mysterious Voice: MuahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHA...</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Oh no... it's them! Iris, help me!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Muahahahaha!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... You're not Agatio and Karst.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> MOAHAHAHAHA!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> What. The. Hell?!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Mwehehehe... I am the evillest being on Weyard. Nobody is eviller than me!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Why are you wearing clown makeup?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> To make me look even more evil!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Seriously? It just makes you look silly.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> You cannot understand true evil.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Say... that flowing hair and that voice are very familiar... you're not 
supposed to be me, are you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> I am Alex, the future ruler of Weyard.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> This is a nightmare. Right? Right?! *pinches self* Ow.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> I ate a baby yesterday. It was the most delicious baby ever.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> o.0;;;<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Babies taste great with mustard and ketchup, did you know that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Of course not!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> And I just love to kick puppies!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Why would you kick a cute, harmless animal?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Pffft. Cute and harmless things need to be destroyed.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Wow. Do I want to know what else you like to do?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Talking at the theater.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *gasp*<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Not just that, but I put my 
seat back on planes just for the heck of it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... Y-you monster! 
Wait, hold on, we don't have planes and theaters in Weyard!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Well, if we did, I would still 
do it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Is being evil really 
that fun?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Sure it is! Why, I wreaked 
havoc upon an entire city, playing with nature and made everyone run away 
screaming!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Wait, you can do that?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Oh, sorry, it was actually in 
Sim City. But, wow, I wish I could just like, destroy an entire town. With 
people inside. It would be so fun!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I'm just going to 
ignore the first sentence. But seriously, people inside? At least I had the 
decency to wait until Vale was empty. Sheesh.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Come on, Alex, you got to 
think more evil.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Yeah? And what do you 
suggest?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Like... secretly serving them 
anchovy pizza.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *blink* I know there's 
pizza in Tolbi, but...<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Or shake cans of beer and put 
them back in the fridge!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I don't even know what 
a fridge is.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Oh, Alex, Alex, Alex... you 
have so much to learn.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Riiight... can you 
suggest something that's actually possible to do in this world?!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Hmm. You could go and get a 
woman pregnant and then just abandon her?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Look, if I have sex 
with a woman, it's going to be for a very good reason.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Funny, you didn't object to 
the abandoning part.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Yes, well, I'm hardly 
going to settle down and become a father. Not my thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> But you could tell all sorts 
of terrible dad jokes! Or utterly traumatise your child, or-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Can we please change 
the subject already? You're getting on my nerves.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Ahh, do I annoy you? And here 
I thought we could be good friends.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I don't know, dude, 
you're kind of creeping me out. I think I'll come up with my own evil things to 
do, thanks.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Well, if you need any ideas... 
I've got plenty of them. For example, what if you could put people in pools and 
remove the ladders? Or remove the doors and seal them inside forever?! *laughs 
evilly*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> There you go, not 
making any sense again...<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Oh, excuse me. Sometimes I 
just play The Sims as an outlet, but wow, some of the things I wish I could do 
in real life. Imagine how it feels to be a god, to have these people's lives in 
your hands, laughing maniacally as you set off rockets indoors and watch them 
burn!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Hey, I have to ask... 
was all that stuff about eating babies even true?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Er, uh... well, maybe not.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> And the part about 
kicking puppies?<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> ... A dog once bit my leg so I 
kicked it away. That counts, right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Are you even being 
serious right now?! Have you actually done anything evil to others?!<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> Um... does trolling or killing 
players in MMORPGs count?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *blink* Um. Sure. Why 
not.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> But do not worry, for I will 
one day become the most feared being in all of Weyard! *laughs maniacally*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, sure. Good luck 
with that, buddy.<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> First though, I must get the rest of the Golden Sun's power off 
that pathetic brat, Isaac.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh, right. Well, don't let me stop you...<br />
<img height="32" src="evilalex.png" width="32" /> MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! *warps out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... I honestly have no 
idea what that was all about.</p>
