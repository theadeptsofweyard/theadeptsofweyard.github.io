<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What 
the...? All of a sudden, I'm in a dark place?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like dark places...
<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What 
the-! <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniff* It's so dark 
and so alone... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nobody can see me cry 
in this dark and lonely place...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Was your 
icon edited in MSPaint?! <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am not even worthy 
of a better painting program... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What the 
heck are you?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am... an emo... 
*sob*&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That 
didn't really answer my question. <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I tried to kill the 
pain and only brought more... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay. Now 
the webmistress is yanking Evanescence lyrics. *facepalm* <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I lay dying, pouring 
crimson regret and betrayal. Am I too lost to be saved? Am I too lost?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are 
you even emo?! Where does anyone get the idea that I'm emo?! <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Nobody loves me. 
Everybody hates me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh come on, 
you know that's not true.<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers got mad at me 
the other day...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why was 
that?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because I was 
screaming obscenities at the seagulls and then I hit a rock. Sniffle.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. Well, 
that's honestly completely reasonable to me. Though seagulls are annoying...<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right, right? It 
pooped on me! Seagulls hate me!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They poop 
all over the damn place, I know. I can't stand them either.<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sometimes I think I 
want to just jump off the ship into the sea and drown... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... I'm 
not even sure I'm capable of drowning... <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I've had such a 
harsh, cruel life... woe is me! <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is 
getting boring fast. Do you ever stop whining? <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The cookie jar was 
empty last night. *sobs wretchedly* I wanted the last cookie and I couldn't have 
it. WHY ME?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *facepalms 
again* <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And the weather's 
been so horrible lately... the clouds hate me, I know they do. Everybody hates 
me. Nobody loves me.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, 
well... there's no controlling the weather, you know?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Think I'll just go 
eat worms...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Am I 
seriously written like THIS in fanfiction?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Would you rather have 
had your overprotective self?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh. Good 
point. And what's the deal with that anyway?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Beats me. Sniff. 
Jenna gets mad if I try to interfere with her life.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Like... I 
know neither Isaac or Garet would hurt her, you know?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They treat her well. 
Maybe she doesn't need me after all...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The absolute 
last thing I'm going to do is chase them away from her!<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um. Yeah. I guess.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> All that 
matters to me is that Jenna is happy. You feel the same, right?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. Jenna's happy. 
Unlike me... have you SEEN the Sun Saga books?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, I 
thought you were pre-end of... no, forget it. I'm not going to try and figure it 
out.<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They hate me! They 
all hate me! *sobs wretchedly* The things that they called me!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Yeah. I. 
Uh. The fact we're integrating future game stuff in here now is kind of making 
things weird.<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Doesn't it bother you 
at all?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, maybe 
that explains why I've apparently hidden away for thirty years.<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Exactly! Just hide 
away where nobody can find you, in isolation and despair, forever... become a 
hobo with a thick, bushy beard...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ehh... but 
seriously though, I don't recall ever being emo or overly angsty. Do I really 
give off that vibe?<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, believe me, 
you'll be in despair soon enough when people are slandering you for saving the 
world.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This just 
doesn't seem logical at all... <br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Logic has no place... 
in a dark, cruel place like this... <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Therefore, you shouldn't even exist!<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Crawling in my 
skiiiiiiin... these wounds... they will not heal...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please, 
leave. I've had enough of you.<br>
<img src="emofelix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sniff* You hate me 
too. Everybody hates me. *falls down dimensional hole, 
still weeping* <br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is 
so messed up. Thank goodness that freaky me is gone. That was just terrible...<br>
