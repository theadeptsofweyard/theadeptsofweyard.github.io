<p align="center">Jenna's Diary</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">I had fun burning a bunch of men. Kraden was scared I was 
hurting them. I probably was. Then Felix and Sheba somehow washed up on an 
island... and it's floating. If this island doesn't stop floating around, I 
swear I'm going to burn something... or someone.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Ew. Seaweed in my hair. Stupid tidal wave. But at least that 
jerk Alex disappeared so that's good, and we're continuing the quest now that 
Idejima decided to reconnect itself to a continent...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Stupid Alex appeared again in Daila, looking for a boat. At 
least he didn't rejoin us. Alex is kind of good looking, but really, really 
annoying. REALLY annoying.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba's annoying too. She keeps trying to read my mind and find 
out my secrets. Ugh. I'd better be careful.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh? Sheba wears hairspray? I had no idea. Honest. It was just a 
teeny, tiny little Flare anyway...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">I found some suspicious looking cockroaches in my bag. Where did 
they come from? Burned them all anyway. Sheba looked disappointed. What, did she 
expect me to freak out or something? Looks like her revenge backfired. Ha.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">What's this, a new Djinni? A WATER Djinni? We don't even have a 
Water Adept yet! Well, we used to...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">I am not holding that Djinni. It will mess with my Psynergy. 
Sheba should have it!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">I am going to set fire to that forsaken Djinni that is making us 
chase it all over Dehkan Plateau! ... But it is a Fire Djinni, and I really want 
it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, we found a ship that looks like Saturos and Menardi's one. I 
hope this one can move... but we'd better find its owner first, I guess.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">There's a guy named Piers in jail, in Madra, and he sure likes 
to use his Psynergy. Everyone in Vale would have a heart attack if they saw 
it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">Why are people even guarding a bridge to Osenia? Don't they want 
people to go to Osenia? We got permission, but surely I could have just burned 
those people at the bridge if they didn't let us through...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">I'M GOING TO KILL KRADEN FOR NAMING EVERY SINGLE TREE! ... But 
Felix won't let me. Darn it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">Mikasalla is boring. Let's go somewhere else already.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">We just saw a werewolf, and Kraden is a lying old fart...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden wants to expose the poor werewolves. I think we should 
just leave them alone...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to Air's Rock now, once Sheba and I managed to drag Kraden 
away from a werewolf.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">Um, wow, Air's Rock looks pretty big. I hope we aren't going to 
be in here too long.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">There is sand everywhere. Too much sand. And it is blowing 
around. Ugh.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">I really, really want to blow something up right now...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">How much longer are we going to be stuck in this stupid rock?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">If I find the people who built this rock, I'm going to make 
their lives a living hell. Unless they are dead already... probably are. Poop.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally, we have got to the end and Sheba got her Psynergy, so 
let's go back to the werewolf village, Garoh, now and I can have a bath...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">We met some werewolf guy named Maha. The werewolves actually 
seem quite nice.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">Now we're at Alhafra after helping some people through a 
desert...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Found Alex in Alhafra's inn. Why is he hanging around here?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Had fun beating up some pirates to prove Piers innocent. I've 
got to remember to be quiet when eavesdropping...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">Returned to Madra, but Piers's not here because someone stole 
his shiny thingy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">Why do we have to sneak through the mountain? Why don't we just 
beat everyone up instead?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">Stupid Sheba ran to hug that guard dog, and we got dragged back 
to the entrance because Felix is being a damn pacifist. Finally made it through 
though...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers got his orb back, so he's happy, but now we have to go 
all the way back to Madra...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba is evil. First she told that freaky woman Karst that Isaac 
was the one who killed her sister, Menardi so now she's swearing revenge, and 
then she teased me about liking Isaac. I feel like blowing her up...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">On the ship now. Sheba appears to be seasick. Well, that serves 
her right. I really want to go see Vale again and a bunch of other places too, 
but it's not a good idea according to Kraden. How annoying.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm just taking out my rage on innocent seagulls. They burn 
nicely.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, Kraden discovered Piers's super secret alcohol stash and 
Piers doesn't seem happy. Selfish Lemurian.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">Yay, Piers said we could try the stuff after all! But not 
Sheba, hah. She's still being seasick all the time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Woke up this morning with an annoying headache and being quite 
unable to remember anything I did last night.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden's banned us from drinking the alcohol now. That damn old 
fart. I'm going to kill him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Hmm, I think I remember some things about that night, like 
dancing on the table... I hope I danced well... and I remember making out 
with... eh, it was probably Piers. I told Felix about it and he acted weird. 
Probably just being an annoyingly overprotective older brother as usual. Give it 
a break!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Eh? Is it just me or is Felix avoiding me all of a sudden? 
Weird. Anyway, I wonder if I found Piers to be a good kisser. I can't remember 
very well after all... I'm not even sure it was Piers... but it must have been, 
right?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba seems to be getting better. We're off to Gaia Rock now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba got drunk on sake that that guy Susa was giving to the 
serpent and ended up removing her clothes... idiot. But we had fun killing the 
serpent.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">So, Felix got Sand and Sheba is very sorry for getting drunk... 
I still don't know why Kraden banned us from drinking...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers got Parch at Aqua Rock so now we're picking up Trident 
pieces...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">Had lots of fun playing in snow. I built a huge snowman. I 
didn't have a carrot for the nose though...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">How many Trident Pieces are there to get? Hope there aren't too 
many...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">Only three, it seems. Good... going to so much trouble to get 
them all is annoying. Whose idea was it to put them in three different places?! 
I'll kill them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Helped the pirate guy to escape, so we're chasing him to his 
hometown now, and he took the ship he bought from the Alhafrans. Serves that 
dirty old Alhafran mayor right for being a jerkass.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">Some old lady fixed the Trident for us. I still want to know who 
the moron was that broke it and put it in three different places... saw Alex 
again with Karst and some guy named Agatio. They are even more impatient than I 
am and 'nicely' asked us to hurry up and light the lighthouses...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">Why is there all this fog around Lemuria? Are they hiding from 
something?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Looks like the world is shrinking, and we'd better light the 
remaining lighthouses so that it doesn't shrink anymore...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">Heading to some village that has shamans in it now. I wish I 
could have just blown up that annoying rock and we would have got here sooner...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Sexist men made us do some hard work to get the Hover Jade and 
almost didn't let Sheba and I join in because we are girls. They really are a 
bunch of sexist jerks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to Jupiter Lighthouse now. We are totally not doing this 
now just because those annoying Proxians wanted us to do it quickly.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac and his friends joined us after we saved them from being 
killed by psycho Mars Adepts and we lit Jupiter Lighthouse too. Isaac and the 
others are willing to help us go and light Mars Lighthouse now that we told them 
that one-eyed rock is lying scum.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden's letting us all drink to celebrate joining. Felix 
doesn't seem very happy about it. What is his problem anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">Another headache, yay, and Garet was on the bed next to me. 
Uh... but I don't think we did anything... just made out. I've got to stop doing 
that! At least he didn't throw up...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">Cleaned up the mess on the ship finally. Sheba knows about me 
and Garet. Great, she's going to tease me about Garet next, the annoying 
little...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Apparently making out wasn't the only thing Garet and I did, 
according to Ivan and Sheba. We also blew some things up on a rampage. Whoops. 
So that's what those strange marks everywhere were... and Mia was responsible 
for all the vomit, Isaac took off his clothes, and Piers and Felix were making 
out. Kraden said Felix had a nasty habit of making out when drunk... and then 
looked at me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">Does that mean it wasn't Piers I made out with the first 
time...? Asked Kraden, he confirmed it then ran like hell before I could burn 
him. Uh... <i>ew</i>. I'm not touching that stuff anymore, I don't want to make 
out with Kraden next or anything... *shudder*</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">So, uh, Felix and Piers were making out...? I'd wonder if that 
meant something, but alcohol seems to render our brains completely dead... so I 
doubt it... and now that Garet seems to think our making out session meant 
something. I'm not sure if I should tell him about making out with my brother...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">I got a Psynergy in Magma Rock, and then we went and blew up a 
wall in Loho! We even got a cannon for our trouble. I want to use it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Blew up a wall of ice on way to Prox. Boring. I want to blow up 
Alhafra instead.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">The lying one-eyed rock turned Agatio and Karst into dragons in 
Mars Lighthouse. Beat them up and got Mars Star back. I think they died.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Went to light Mars Lighthouse, but then that lying rock sicked a 
three headed dragon on us so now we need to beat it up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Sicking my own parents and Isaac's dad on us?! That was mean! 
But at least they lived in the end and I swear I DID NOT CRY. I DID NOT.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Going back to Vale now! Yay!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, great, Vale sank into the ground... but at least everyone 
got out so that's good... can we go and have a vacation now?</p>
