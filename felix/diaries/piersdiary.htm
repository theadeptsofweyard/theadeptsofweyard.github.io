<p align="center">Piers's Diary</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Na-na-na-na-na, fi-shing. Na-na-na-na-na, fi-shing!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Where the heck am I? Some tidal wave sent me sailing out of 
Lemuria and I seem to have hit the coast somewhere...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">This doesn't look good. A bunch of angry people found me and are 
dragging me somewhere. They are yelling about "Champa".</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">What is a Champa and why does everyone keep calling me it?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Jail is so boring...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Am I ever going to be let out? I don't even know who the heck 
this Briggs guy is...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">I want to go back to Lemuria...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">I hope my ship is okay... they took my shiny black orb that 
controls it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">How come there are puddles of water on the floor anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">I seem to be spending quite a long time in jail...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">Some people came by and watched me almost freeze an annoying guy 
in a block of ice. He deserved it anyway.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">Apparently the whole town is freaked out about me turning water 
into ice. Whoops.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">When King Hydros wanted me to go see the outside world, I don't 
think he had this in mind...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">It's kind of ironic I left Lemuria by accident...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm not bored at all. Honest. It takes much longer than this for 
Lemurians to get bored.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">Maybe I'll try counting sheep... one sheep... two sheep... three 
sheep...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Two thousand sheep... two thousand and one sheep... two thousand 
and two sheep...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">At this rate, I think I'll go insane.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">Is there a way to escape? No? Drat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">How did those Champa guys escape from this jail? I wish I 
knew...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">I have just discovered trying to lick my elbow is very 
difficult. Must... lick... elbow...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">Still can't lick elbow. Was a nice waste of time though.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">Has it really been more than three weeks?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">I think I shall write an autobiography when I get out.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Wrongfully Imprisoned: </i>My Time in Madra Jail. Now isn't 
that a nice title?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">I have the feeling it would be pretty boring though and nobody 
would want to read it. Rats.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Great, some guys attacked and stole my pretty shiny orb. But now 
they believe I'm innocent and let me out of jail! Yay!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm off to Kibombo to get my orb back. They will pay for 
stealing it, those jerks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">Sneaking through that mountain was pretty easy. I think I'll 
wait until the ceremony begins for some reason.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">It's beginning soon... really, why can't I just blast everyone 
with ice and take it back? That would be much simpler.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Waiting paid off. Those guys I saw when in jail came and helped 
me, and I got my orb back! Yay!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba seems to be evil or something. She told on a person named 
Isaac for killing some crazy lady's sister. Felix, Jenna and Kraden seem 
worried. I would be worried too if I was Isaac.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Back on my beloved ship. Thankfully, it seems to be in perfect 
condition. There were a lot of monsters on it though.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">What did those innocent seagulls do? Jenna is burning them 
all...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Crap. Kraden found the secret alcohol stash. Am not happy about 
that.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">Let them drink it anyway. Hope there aren't drinking laws in 
Weyard otherwise I'm in trouble. Sheba isn't having any though, she's seasick.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna has impressive table dancing skills, but the siblings seem 
to have ridiculously low constitution. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden won't let them drink again. I agree with him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">How clueless they seem to be about what they did that night. I'm 
not telling them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Does Sheba ever stop being sick? She's still seasick...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Looks like she's getting better finally. We're going to Gaia 
Rock now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">It was Sheba's turn to get drunk this time. Susa was feeding the 
serpent something and she thought it would be a good idea to try it... my eyes 
feel dirty.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">Doing Aqua Rock next...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Done with rocks. Time to do trident quest.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">When was the last time I ever got to see snow? Had a lot of fun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">Just who would put pieces of a trident in three different 
places?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally done with that...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Chasing pirate guy who unintentionally got me jailed to hometown 
after he escaped from jail. How does he do that? I want to know.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">Trident was fixed by nice old lady. Met girly looking guy named 
Alex who used to travel with Felix and others. He's a meanie.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">Nobody seems to like the fog around Lemuria. I guess I can 
understand why.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">My mom died while I was away. And, uh, world is definitely 
shrinking. Wow, I got over the dead mother thing fast.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">Heading to some place named Shaman Village now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna and Sheba are pissed off at sexist shamans... but we got 
the Hover Jade, so all's good.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">And we're off to Jupiter Lighthouse...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">Insane Mars Adepts attempted to kill us. Saved Isaac's group, 
who joined us, and lit Jupiter Lighthouse. That was certainly... exciting.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">We're having another party? Sounds like a disaster with more 
people around, but what the heck, let's have a party.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">That was a really fun party, heh. Am I the only one who didn't 
have a hangover?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">I don't really appreciate the fact my ship was left a big mess, 
but it's been cleaned up now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Felix knows about us kissing in the cupboard now. I wish I could 
remember who initiated it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">Felix doesn't seem all that delighted about it. I'm not sure if 
I should feel sad or not...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">He's still freaked out. Wonderful...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">Apparently, in Loho, blowing up walls gets you a cannon. Great.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Blowing up that wall of ice was very dangerous! Even if we had 
to do it to reach Prox...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">Felix got the Mars Star back after we beat up two dragons, who 
were Agatio and Karst. That eyeball thing sounds scary...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Eyeball thing sicked three-headed dragon on us at the Mars 
Lighthouse aerie. Yikes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Dragon was Felix and Jenna's parents and Isaac's dad. Well, that 
really sucks... eyeball thing is insane. But they lived, so it was okay.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">We're going to Vale now. I can't wait to see it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Well, <i>that</i> was a disappointment. It was a sunken hole in 
the ground by the time we got back...</p>
