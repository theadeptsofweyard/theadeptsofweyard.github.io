<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>Those crazy Vale Elders <i>like </i>the idea of the world shrinking and our 
town being destroyed? What is wrong with them?</p>
<p><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p>I bet it's because we have pointy ears and red eyes, right? That's 
discrimination. Those jerks.</p>
<p><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p>We're going to steal the Elemental Stars tonight. This should be fun.</p>
<p><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p>Well, crap. All we did was trigger a storm and everyone except Menardi and I 
were killed. We did manage to fish four Valeans out of the nearby river though.</p>
<p><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p>We're going to take the Valeans back home to Prox by ship and... uh, I don't 
know yet. Menardi is in a really bad mood, she keeps burning things. Please 
don't burn our hostages...</p>
<p><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p>Those adults seem really scared of us, they have barely said a word to us 
since we kidnapped them. I think the ship ride must be pretty rough for them, 
that sickly kid keeps throwing up. I'm not cleaning up his vomit...</p>
<p><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p>Finally got back to Prox. Okay, when can we go out again?</p>
<p><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p>Three years? IN THREE YEARS? And they want me to go and tell Menardi... I'm 
scared...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>3 Years Later</i></p>
<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>Well, waiting three years made sense. The kid was a Venus Adept and he's old 
enough to come travelling with us. So, Menardi, Felix, Alex and I are heading to 
Vale for our next heist. Let's hope it goes well.</p>
<p><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p>Felix is being emo as usual, he won't come out of the inn. I think those 
Valeans are scared of Menardi and I. I don't care. We're just going to scare an 
old man now. Where did Alex go anyway?</p>
<p><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p>Great. We got away with only 3 Elemental Stars and picked up a rambling old 
man and Felix's little sister. We'd better get the Mars Star soon.</p>
<p><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p>Does Alex ever stop swinging his hair like that? It's so irritating. Maybe 
Menardi will burn it off. That would be nice.</p>
<p><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p>Oh great. Felix's sister (Jenna) is a Mars Adept too. I have a phobia of 
female Mars Adepts...</p>
<p><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p>Woke up to Kraden lecturing at me about the dangers of Alchemy. What was he 
doing in my tent?</p>
<p><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p>Tried securing my tent against trespassers. Alex warped in at the crack of 
dawn asking for hairgel. Ugh.</p>
<p><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p>For a second there, I thought Jenna was going to burn Kraden when he decided 
to talk about clouds for no reason at all. It seemed like she stopped herself in 
time... too bad.</p>
<p><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p>Menardi yelled at me when I ate the last of the fruit for breakfast. She sure 
is cranky this morning...</p>
<p><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p>Snow everywhere. It almost feels like home. Menardi is being nice for once. 
She's not snapping at everyone.</p>
<p><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p>Made a quick rest stop at Imil, but Alex didn't accompany us. What is it with 
people avoiding their hometowns?</p>
<p><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p>Where did Alex go? We'll just have to wait for him to come back. What a waste 
of time... Kraden is suggesting we have fun in the snow. Am ignoring him. Felix 
and Jenna don't seem so interested either. Menardi... she looks homicidal...</p>
<p><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p>Finally, Alex came back. Wouldn't say where he went. We can finally set off 
to the Mercury Lighthouse.</p>
<p><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p>Almost at the aerie... I just wish Kraden wouldn't keep stopping and gushing 
over every single little thing he sees.</p>
<p><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p>Good news: Mercury Lighthouse lit. Bad news: Got ass handed to self by four 
brats and had to be saved by Alex. I will never live this down...</p>
<p><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p>Menardi pushed some trees over. I'm not sure why she did that... or why she 
didn't just burn them.</p>
<p><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p>Had to swim through a river. Nobody was manning that dratted bridge. Who even 
plants a tree next to a bridge?</p>
<p><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p>Almost got lost passing through the Mogall Forest. At least some of the group 
had the sense to hold hands instead of wandering off.</p>
<p><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p>Stopped for rest at Xian. Those people certainly speak funny.</p>
<p><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p>Alex disappeared again. Great.</p>
<p><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p>There's some weird girl living here who has voices in her head apparently. 
How strange.</p>
<p><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p>Where the heck is Alex? Menardi is on verge of going on an insane rampage.</p>
<p><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p>Alex mysteriously reappeared, claiming that he was merely scouting out the 
area ahead of us. Curse him and his warping powers.</p>
<p><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p>Went to Altin for a change of scenery. It's flooded with monster spit. Gross.</p>
<p><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p>Kraden wants us to investigate the mystery behind the spit. Told him to go 
shut his trap.</p>
<p><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p>There are children swimming in the spit? Actually, now that I think about it, 
it looks like water... but still, ew.</p>
<p><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p>This time wasting is getting ridiculous. Why aren't we moving on? Are they 
trying to see how much more flooded this town can get?</p>
<p><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p>Now Kraden is swimming. Ew. I did not need to see that.</p>
<p><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p>We're finally getting a move on and going through Altin Crossing. It's about 
time. Menardi blasted at the cliffs during mid-rant and made some boulders block 
the road. She sure is scary.</p>
<p><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p>This desert is supposed to be hot? I have no idea what everyone is talking 
about. Menardi and I sure can't feel it.</p>
<p><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p>Alex, Felix, Jenna and Kraden look all sweaty. Why don't they just change 
into something cooler then?</p>
<p><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p>Finally out of desert. We must go to Kalay so that certain non-Proxians can 
bathe... frankly, they stink.</p>
<p><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p>Looks like we'll have to take a ship from the Kalay dock because the road is 
blocked. It wasn't us this time...</p>
<p><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p>Ship isn't setting sail for a while. Menardi and Jenna went off shopping. 
Apparently Kalay has some nice clothes shops?</p>
<p><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p>If I hear Felix sigh one more time, I swear I'm going to snap. He's being 
randomly emo again...</p>
<p><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p>Kraden's trying to lecture me again. WHY ME?</p>
<p><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p>When is that ship ever going to set sail?</p>
<p><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p>Got bored, snooped through Alex's stuff. Found a bottle of blue hairdye. Am 
very suspicious, but would rather not ask since Alex is a Mercury Adept.</p>
<p><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p>Forgot to mention, there were a make-up kit and some girly accessories in 
there too. Somehow I don't think he pinched them off Jenna or Menardi...</p>
<p><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p>Ship is leaving tomorrow. Why didn't we just go and blast away the blockage 
with our Psynergy? Forget it, I don't want to know.</p>
<p><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p>People on ship keep staring at us. It's kind of creepy.</p>
<p><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p>No. I do not want to look at the dolphins, Kraden. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p>Ship finally reached Tolbi docks. It's about time.</p>
<p><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p>Some thing called Colosso is coming up in Tolbi. It sounds interesting. Too 
bad we can't participate.</p>
<p><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p>I could totally win, you know.</p>
<p><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p>Apparently Tolbi's lord is a dirty pedophile who abducted a 14 year old girl. 
Good grief.</p>
<p><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p>Kraden corrected me. He actually kidnapped her to force people to build a 
lighthouse. What the heck?</p>
<p><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p>Since we aren't going anywhere fast, I might go and see this girl. Apparently 
she's pretty special.</p>
<p><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p>I swear that Sheba girl did something weird to my mind. Told Menardi. We now 
believe she's a Jupiter Adept. We need one.</p>
<p><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p>Instead of abducting her, we're just leaving Tolbi and heading on to the next 
lighthouse? What the heck?</p>
<p><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p>Going to Gondowan Crossing. Kraden seems upset at leaving Tolbi. Too bad we 
can't just leave him there.</p>
<p><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p>Now at a super boring town named Suhalla. Alex vanished again.</p>
<p><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p>This town is so small and boring...</p>
<p><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p>I miss Tolbi. At least it was fun...</p>
<p><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p>Menardi ranted at me ;_; I didn't tell Alex to just vanish...</p>
<p><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p>Apparently there are freaky tornados in the desert that carry people back to 
Suhalla. Great, more weirdness.</p>
<p><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p>Why couldn't we have got a normal Mercury Adept who doesn't randomly 
disappear on us?</p>
<p><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p>Alex finally came back. Menardi seemed to be struggling not to blow him up.</p>
<p><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p>Aw, crap. Felix came down with the flu somehow.</p>
<p><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p>Jenna and Kraden are rushing around tending to Felix while Menardi and I try 
not to burn every thing in sight. Alex... is Alex.</p>
<p><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p>Couldn't Alex heal the flu? Must ask him.</p>
<p><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p>Asked Alex to try it. Flu gone. Why didn't he do it sooner?!</p>
<p><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p>I think Alex is enjoying wasting our time. Tried to get into desert, got 
carried away by giant tornado.</p>
<p><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p>How are we supposed to get past these giant tornados?</p>
<p><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p>Alex made the tornados wet and huge lizards tried to kill us. At least we're 
making progress.</p>
<p><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p>Picked up Sheba, who was being escorted by soldiers. Guess they went back to 
Suhalla. That sure was convenient.</p>
<p><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p>Just camping before we move on. Reflecting on this journey... it's kind of 
been a nightmare. Menardi was more insane than usual, Kraden never shut up, 
Felix kept being emo, Jenna kept screaming at Alex when he pissed her off and 
Alex... well, he's just weird. And a bit creepy.</p>
<p><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p>Some rude people at the Suhalla Gate tried to stop us from passing through 
because we didn't have papers. Menardi and I beat them up.</p>
<p><b>Day 69</b></p>
<p>Reached Venus Lighthouse and burned even people. I think Menardi may have 
killed some. Must tell her to control her temper.</p>
<p><b>Day 70</b></p>
<p>Eh? The entrance is the exit? What a waste of time.</p>
<p><b>Day 71</b></p>
<p>Sheba thinks the real entrance is beneath Babi Lighthouse. She's useful for 
something then...</p>
<p><b>Day 72</b></p>
<p>People in Lalivero were surprised to see us dragging Sheba along. Ignored 
them until we went to Babi Lighthouse and burned even more people.</p>
<p><b>Day 73</b></p>
<p>Alex warped us past strange door that wouldn't open. How the heck was it 
supposed to open anyway?</p>
<p><b>Day 74</b></p>
<p>We're really in the Venus Lighthouse, it seems. Made Felix, Jenna and Kraden 
go back and head to ship. No clue where Alex went.</p>
<p><b>Day 75</b></p>
<p>Why exactly is Sheba coming with us again? I forgot.</p>
<p><b>Day 76</b></p>
<p>We gave Felix the Jupiter Star yet took the Jupiter Adept with us. Pointed 
this logic flaw out to Menardi and she burned me. Ow.</p>
<p><b>Day 77</b></p>
<p>Are we there yet?</p>
<p><b>Day 78</b></p>
<p>Finally at the aerie. Menardi and I feel like just standing and talking 
instead of lighting it for some reason. I have a strange feeling that... hmm, 
it's nothing. I doubt we're going to die here. That would really suck, you know?
