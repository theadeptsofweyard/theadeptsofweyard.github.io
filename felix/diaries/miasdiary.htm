<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Alex looks a bit unhappy lately. I think he's hiding something 
from me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Found Alex poring over papers. He looked startled and very 
quickly hid them. I wonder what's going on.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">More people going down with plague. Luckily, there are still a 
few other Mercury Clan people around to help them. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Built a snowman. I'm tired of snowmen and snowball fights and 
snow angels and snow everything.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Strangely enough, a fever has struck down all the Mercury Clan, 
except me and Alex.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">They all just died, muttering about plot devices. Must prepare 
for funerals.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">More people died because I was so busy with funeral 
preparations. Where is that lazy Alex?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Alex was apparently exploring Mercury Lighthouse. Stupid idiot.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>3 Years Later</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Alex has been missing for a week now. I wonder where he got to 
now...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">The flu has struck again. Am getting tired of running around, 
healing people.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Tried to teach Megan and Justin how to heal flu. Failed. All 
they do is stand in that sanctum...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">There are people outside. WHY ARE THEY OUTSIDE?! Do they WANT to 
get flu?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Am considering just running out of Imil in the night without 
saying a word.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Changed my mind. Can't let innocent people die.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">It's not fair. How come Alex gets to run away and I don't?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Where is that scumbag anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Told Megan and Justin to do some healing for a change. Shut self 
in room.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">Maybe we should just burn down Imil and move south...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">But who would watch Mercury Lighthouse then?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">I. Am. So. BORED.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">That old man had a heart attack again. Got to go and heal him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">Looks like Mercury Lighthouse is in trouble, so I'm travelling 
through it with these three boys.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">Bad news. Mercury Lighthouse lit. Good news. It means I can 
finally leave Imil! I'm going to travel with the boys on their quest.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">We're heading to a forest. Oh, wow... is that GRASS?<i> </i>I'd 
forgotten what it even looked like!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Talking trees?!</i> How is that even possible?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelled to a temple where we found a monk starving himself to 
death. Crazy man.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh no... he keeps reading our minds. I hope he doesn't find out 
my secret...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">We have to get this Force thing, whatever it is. I wonder if it 
has to do with forks?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">It's actually an orb that shoots power. I guess not then.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to another forest now. Thank goodness we're finally 
getting away from that mind reading monk...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">We're lost in the forest. I wonder if there are talking trees 
here too...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">That's odd... I could have sworn I had another pair of panties 
here...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">WHERE ARE MY PANTIES?! Must beat Isaac, Garet and Ivan up until 
they tell me, if necessary.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Why is Garet chasing apes and where did the panties go?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up a giant ape and got a Douse Drop. It's shiny. But I 
still want my panties back.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">I found my panties in Garet's bag. Beat the living hell out of 
him. That creep.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">We've reached a town named Xian. I can buy some more blue dye 
for my hair now!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">Have to find somewhere to dye hair... but we're a bit busy at 
the moment, it seems.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Poor girl is screaming head off in Alpine Crossing...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, damn. Isaac caught me dyeing my hair. If my secret gets 
out...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Altin flooded with monster spit. Don't care. Too worried about 
Isaac knowing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">Riding minecarts in Altin. Maybe I could push Isaac out and 
he'll die and my secret will be safe.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Who am I kidding? I couldn't kill a fly. Well, I am helping kill 
these moving statues actually...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan's freaking out because someone touched his butt. I wonder 
who it was...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac told me Garet touched Ivan's butt. I wonder if I should 
believe Isaac... though, Garet did steal my panties...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet pushed Isaac down huge hole. I think I like Garet a little 
more.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally getting out of mines after getting the Lift Gem. 
Daylight, I missed you...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Well, the monster spit's gone, so we're going through the mines 
again to next destination. I wonder if Isaac's forgotten about the hairdye...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached a temple where creepy woman named Hama lives. She even 
knew my name...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">Helped some fat guy named Hsu trapped under rocks. I think 
Isaac's really forgotten my secret... he hasn't mentioned it lately.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">This desert is just... too... hot. So I'll just blast myself 
with ice. Ahh, how refreshing...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac just tried to drown Garet. I wonder what's up with him?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan's got some nasty bruises on his throat now. Oh, great, I 
hope Isaac doesn't pick on me next...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh. He hasn't done anything to me yet. Guess I'm safe.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">We're finally out of that horrible desert...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached a place named Kalay. Can finally change sandy, sweaty 
clothes...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">So, Ivan's master was kidnapped but his wife wants us to 
continue with quest? No problem.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet thought Ivan's master was a eunuch, apparently. Wonder 
why...?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Something to do with that stick Ivan has, it seems. Uh... okay, 
Garet...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac asked me what the quest was. Doesn't he realise we're 
stopping lighthouses from being lit? He's not as dumb as Garet though... which 
Ivan and I agreed on.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Managed to dye hair again without being caught. Whew.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">How can Garet not know what an ocean is?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">Protecting people from monsters on ship. I'm tired of looking 
after others...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">Hmm, these sea monsters do taste quite nice... like fish.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">Yikes! I never want to fight anything with tentacles ever again!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">Got to Tolbi. It doesn't seem that exciting...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Have to get draught for invisible man. Why can't people take 
care of their own business for once?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">This cave is too dark. I'm scared someone might feel me up and 
get away with it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">Well, we have the draught now. Those lights were so colourful 
and pretty...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">Uh... Garet didn't think the invisible man was a man? Did he 
think it was a woman with a deep voice?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Looks like Isaac's fighting in Colosso. By himself.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to Venus Lighthouse with some man named Iodem... well, at 
least he's not a teenager.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Where's my bra?! Garet... I swear... if it's you...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Found my bra in Iodem's bag. GARET! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelling through a frightening desert full of tornadoes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Why did Isaac just try to throw Ivan at a tornado?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 69</b></p>
<p align="left">Wow, Isaac's a wuss. He made us run out of the desert away from 
a really big tornado...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 70</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet insisted we go back in and fight it. I guess we should...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 71</b></p>
<p align="left">Some soldiers got beaten up at gate because they thought it 
would be a good idea to try stop psycho Mars Adepts from passing...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 72</b></p>
<p align="left">Looks like the entrance of Venus Lighthouse is really the exit. 
How confusing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 73</b></p>
<p align="left">We're in Venus Lighthouse now. Oh, and NO MORE IODEM! He was a 
bit too noisy...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 74</b></p>
<p align="left">Are we going to reach the aerie soon?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 75</b></p>
<p align="left">What's with this annoying sandfall?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 76</b></p>
<p align="left">Lost track of how many times we fell off the sandfall...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 77</b></p>
<p align="left">Huh?! We can run?! This is madness!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 78</b></p>
<p align="left">Madness? This is the AERIE! ... Oh, and we're fighting Saturos 
and Menardi. Ivan handed over the stick too.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 79</b></p>
<p align="left">Uh... so Felix just jumped off the lighthouse for Sheba? Wow, 
how heroic...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 80</b></p>
<p align="left">Sailing on ship Babi gave us. Of course, our quest is more 
important than saving his life. So long, sucker!</p>
