<p align="center">Felix's Diary</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">I seriously just managed to swim from a lighthouse to an island 
floating on the sea. I rock. And am now about to faint from exhaustion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">So, Jenna, Sheba, Kraden and I are off for an adventure. Alex 
abandoned us. Good riddance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Saw Alex again after saving some kids in a tower. He disappeared 
again. Good.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">I just love not having to put up with Alex... he was so 
creepy...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Seems Jenna found out the secret to Sheba's hair. It's 
hairspray. And flammable too. Luckily, managed to put the fire out.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden is rambling at me about geology for no reason at all. I 
want to die...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Got Lash at Kandorean Temple. And a Mercury Djinni.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba and Jenna are fighting over who holds the Mercury Djinni. 
Because neither of them want it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Chasing an annoying Mars Djinni all over Dehkan Plateau. My butt 
hurts...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">Saw a ship. Somehow, I doubt it's the one that belonged to 
Saturos and Menardi...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Madra. There's a guy in jail, who everyone thinks is one 
of the Champa. Think his name is Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, whoops. His name is Piers. Not sure why I thought his name 
was Jean-Luc Picard. Going to Osenia 
now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">Had to stop Jenna from killing Kraden because Kraden thought it 
would be fun to name every tree we walked past.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached boring town named Mikasalla. So boring, it seems like a 
nice place to... sleep.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">Arrived at Garoh. It's creepy and... I think I saw a werewolf! 
;_;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden wants to expose the werewolves through any means 
necessary. Including with sharp and dangerous weapons.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna and Sheba managed to distract him, so we're going to Airs 
Rock now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">It's... a pretty big place.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">Sand... everywhere...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna is on verge of blowing things up, I fear. She looks 
positively homicidal.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">Are we ever going to get through this?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">I hope we don't starve here...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally reached end. Sheba got Reveal. Now we'll go back to 
Garoh...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">Met a werewolf named Maha. I'm just glad they are nice 
werewolves and not insane, bloodthirsty monsters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">Got through a desert, and reached Alhafra.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Yikes. Alex is hanging around in the inn. Let's get out of here 
quickly! ;_;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up a pirate and his buddies, to prove Piers innocent.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">Returned to Madra. Piers went to Kibombo to reclaim his 
precious orb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">Going through mountain. Jenna wants to beat everyone up, but 
it's better to sneak through...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally through. Sheba did not help at all when she suddenly ran 
up and hugged that guard dog...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Got to Kibombo and helped Piers get orb back. Back to Madra... 
again.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">Menardi's scary sister, Karst, was hanging around Madra and 
wants to kill Isaac now. I feel ill...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Alright! We're on the ship now! Sheba seems to be seasick...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna keeps burning the poor seagulls. What did they ever do?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden found a secret cellar on the ship. It's full of bottles 
too. Piers doesn't seem too happy...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers said we could try that stuff! But not Sheba. She's too 
busy being seasick anyway.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Got utterly wasted. I can't remember anything that happened last 
night. I remember making out with someone. Piers?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden's forbidden us from drinking the alcohol for some reason. 
Why?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna thinks she was making out with someone that night... OH 
BLOODY HELL!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Confronted Kraden and he confirmed it. I feel sick now...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba is finally feeling better so... we're off to Gaia Rock...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up a serpent. Apparently, Susa was getting it drunk. Sheba 
tried the sake and ended up taking off her clothes...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">Sheba is very remorseful. That stuff is pure evil... oh, and I 
learned Sand.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers learned Parch at Aqua Rock, so we're going to collect 
Trident pieces now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">Wasted hours before Tundaria Tower, playing in snow. What a 
waste of time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">Done Temple of Sea God. One more piece to go.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally got all three pieces... so sick of this...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Accidentally let the pirate escape. Oh well. Off to Champa.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">Nice old lady fixed the Trident after using huge lizard to try 
and kill us. Oh, and Alex appeared again with Karst and another guy. No biggie.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">Whose idea was it to surround Lemuria with fog?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Lemuria is so dull. Learned the world is shrinking and stuff.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">The Western Sea is accessible now. Going to village with 
shamans.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally, we no longer have the inventory wasting Shaman's Rod 
and we have the Hover Jade instead!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to Jupiter Lighthouse now. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">Lots of stuff happened. Mars Adepts tried to kill us, saved 
Isaac's life, lit Jupiter Lighthouse, oh, and Isaac and co. joined us.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">Great. Kraden dragged out the alcohol for another party. I 
should have thrown all the bottles out. Piers wouldn't have minded, right?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">Woke up with pounding headache. How did I get dragged into that 
party anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally finished cleaning ship. It was a total wreck. I wonder 
what happened at the party?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan and Sheba told us. Garet and Jenna went on a rampage for 
some reason and blew stuff up, Mia threw up everywhere, Isaac was running around 
the ship naked and Piers and I were apparently kissing in the cupboard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm not sure which is worse. No, wait, making out with Jenna was 
definitely worse. She's my sister after all.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers's a guy. <i>A guy</i>. So confused...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna got Blaze in Magma Rock, then we went and blew up a wall 
in Loho, and got a cannon for our trouble.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">We're finally on route to Prox. Blew up a wall of ice as well. 
The cannon is fun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up two dragons in Mars Lighthouse. They turned out to be 
Agatio and Karst. Weird. Oh yeah, got Mars Star back.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Went to light Mars Lighthouse. One-eyed rock sicked three-headed 
dragon on us.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Dragon was parents and Isaac's dad. Whoops. Luckily, they lived, 
and the lighthouse got lit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Going back to Vale now. Thank goodness...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Vale sank into the ground. Crap. Fortunately, everyone made it 
out.</p>
