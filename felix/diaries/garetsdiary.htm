<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac not talking to me. Well, fine, I won't talk to him either! 
He's such a jerk! Just ate five bowls of fried rice. Yum.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Got revenge on Isaac by stealing and eating his cookies. Before 
learning Isaac's actually lost his voice. Whoops.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">I am very scared. Isaac and Felix keep giving me scary looks. 
Must ask Jenna what's going on... after asking her if we can date. But first, 
I'm going to eat that leg of ham left over from lunch.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna rejected me again! Oh, and that boulder on Mt. Aleph fell 
last night too. Felix got washed away along with parents and Isaac's dad. I 
heroically tried to save all the food in the house by pulling it in a chest, but 
stupid Isaac stopped me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna is being emo. Maybe if I help her cheer up, she'll date 
me. I've got some food we could share.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Grounded for breaking vase. Can't see Jenna. Am very sad. Will 
cheer self up by eating entire cookie jar.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">They stopped searching for Felix and everyone else. Wow, what 
pessimists. Was bored today, so I ate the cake for Kay's birthday. I'll blame it 
on Aaron.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Got away with it. Except then I was caught eating that pound of 
beef out of the larder. I didn't realise it was for dinner.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>3 Years Later</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">I accidentally burned Isaac while practicing Psynergy, because I 
was thinking about that box of muffins I wanted to eat later. Whoops.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">My tummy hurts. I shouldn't have eaten that bowl of pasta, that 
left over pizza, the last slice of ham, that chicken leg, those biscuits and 
that slice of cake all at once... oh, yeah, I forgot the potato chips. And that 
slice of steak pie.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Some freaky people robbed Vale, and Felix was with them. Oh, I 
guess he's alive then. Jenna and Kraden went off with them. I want to have a 
feast to celebrate Kraden's leaving, but we haven't got time. Have to prepare to 
go on world saving quest tomorrow with Isaac.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Bag too heavy... well, it was, until Isaac threw out half the 
food in it! Bastard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Met a kid named Ivan. His master is a eunuch. I wonder what it's 
like missing a rod. Beat up thieves and Ivan left with stolen stick.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan joined us in Goma Range when we got stuck. Asked him if he 
had food. He doesn't. Sucks. Going to Bilibin. I hope they have some good food.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">When we got to Bilibin, I ate six bowls of chicken curry, then 
had some ice cream and chocolate cake. I then threw up. Apparently there's a 
curse going around turning people into trees. Freaky.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to Kolima Forest. I don't want to be a tree, because then 
I won't be able to eat food. How horrible...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Almost became tree. Damn Isaac, wanting to play the hero. It's 
all his fault.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm hungry. Beat up some talking tree. Now can we go eat? Ivan 
shouted at me for being so greedy. Wah.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">We're in a cold, snowy place. Isaac complained too much so I 
burned him. Ivan won't stop fainting. Stupid Ivan.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Imil. Had some nice hot stew. Okay, a lot of stew. It's 
too damn cold here!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">Gotta find chick named Mia. Popular around here, apparently. 
Everyone's talking about her. Do they even have lives?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelling through Mercury Lighthouse. Mia joined us. She's not 
as good looking as Jenna in my opinion and those thick robes cover up her chest, 
which is a disappointment.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">Mercury Lighthouse got lit. Mia's joined us. Hmm, this could be 
fun. Might have to "accidentally" catch her in the nude a few times.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">Stupid Isaac. Now we have to go back to Kolima Forest with 
healing water for crazy talking tree. Why didn't we leave Kolima Forest until 
later?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Tree sorted out. Heading south... after I've had a hearty meal 
in Kolima. It's time to sample their food now that the villagers aren't trees.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">Weird monk starving himself in temple. I guess he gave up on 
life. I just can't understand how anybody could go through so much suffering...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">Creepy monk kept reading our minds. Made sure I thought about 
nothing but food. That creep ain't going to get anything out of me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">Monk made us get Force Orb. I don't get it. What the heck is it 
for?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">Apparently it shoots stuff. I still don't get it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to freaky forest. Mia seemed rather relieved to get away 
from the mind reading monk. What's up with her?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">We're lost in the stupid forest. I've already eaten half the 
rations. Oops.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">I have a strange feeling that we should follow those apes 
scurrying around. Oh, and the rations are finished. Crap.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">I wonder what ape meat tastes like. Must pursue apes. I am 
starving.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Damn apes. They are too fast for me. I'm... so... hungry. What 
do Djinn taste like?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally escaped forest and got shiny thing. Thankfully found a 
tree with fruit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">Damn it. Mia's panties somehow got in my bag and she took them. 
I tried to tell her I didn't take them, but she beat me senseless anyway. Ow. 
Hurts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">I bet Isaac was the one who put the panties in my bag. One 
day... I'm going to pay him back. We're in Xian now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">A weird purple-haired chick has voices in her head. Well, 
whatever. Food in Xian is great.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Saw the weird chick again, screaming for guy named Kazoo. Or 
whatever it was.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">I ate a whole cake just now. And some sandwiches. And pie. And 
sausages. I'm still hungry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Awesome! Discovered lagoon of monster spit!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">Wandering around in cold, dark mines. Boring.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Disgusting statues spewing water everywhere. Have to kill them 
all dead.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac touched Ivan's butt. He thinks I didn't see, but I saw it 
all. I wonder if I could use this against Isaac.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan and Mia think I touched Ivan's butt. I am going to kill 
Isaac.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Pushed Isaac down giant hole after almost getting crushed by 
boulder. Unfortunately, he didn't die.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Got some Lift Gem. Getting out of mines now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Awesome monster spit is gone. What a shame.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Lama Temple and met some woman who seemed to know Ivan. 
I bet that kid's hiding things.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">For some reason, we helped free a fat dude named... what was it? 
Achoo?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">I hate this blooming hot desert. Ivan, Mia and I will absolutely 
not stop complaining about it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac tried to drown me in oasis. Damn him. Luckily, I survived.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">I think Isaac's in a bad mood. He just tried to strangle Ivan.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac has not tried to do anything to Mia. Just as well, I'll 
kill him if he does.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally got out of this stupid desert. Hopefully Isaac will be 
in a better mood now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Kalay. They have great food. It's Ivan's home as well...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">The eunuch was kidnapped, it seems. Wait, he has a wife?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan just shouted at me. Oh, apparently he wasn't an eunuch. 
Then what was the missing rod thing about?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Seems it was that stick Ivan got in Vault. Whoops.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">It probably should have been obvious. Oh well. I'm just going to 
eat more food.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac asked me what the quest was about. I hit him. How could he 
forget such a thing?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">That jerk Isaac laughed at me for not knowing what an ocean was. 
Set him on fire.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">Got to protect some people on a ship from monsters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">The monsters taste delicious.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">Nearly got tentacle raped by freaky Kraken thing. Am disturbed. 
Am also very disturbed to notice Kraken is spelled similarly to Kraden.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">Got to Tolbi. Trying to get disturbing image of Kraden with 
tentacles out of head.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Found an invisible person hanging out in a cave. Got to get 
draught for them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">This cave is too blooming dark. Can't see!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally got stupid draught.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">The invisible person was a man!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac fighting in Colosso. I want to fight too! Damn him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelling with a man named Iodem to Venus Lighthouse. He talks 
too much.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Mia's bra apparently went missing. Checked bag. Thankfully, her 
bra was not in my bag.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Mia found bra in Iodem's bag. However, she thought I put them 
there and beat me up! Isaac seemed amused. I swear he was the one who put them 
there.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelling through a dangerous desert full of tornadoes. Yikes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac tried throwing Ivan at a tornado. What's his problem?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 69</b></p>
<p align="left">Got chased by a tornado. That cowardly Isaac forced us to escape 
from the desert instead of fighting.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 70</b></p>
<p align="left">Dragged Isaac back into desert so that we could fight lizard. We 
need that experience after all!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 71</b></p>
<p align="left">Found soldiers beaten up at Suhalla Gate, because they tried to 
stop group without papers going through. Serves them right.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 72</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Venus Lighthouse. Bodies everywhere.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 73</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally got to leave Iodem behind. It seems so quiet and 
peaceful now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 74</b></p>
<p align="left">Going through lighthouse... keep slipping on stupid sandfalls. 
How irritating.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 75</b></p>
<p align="left">We absolutely can't get past this particular sandfall. I'm 
getting sick of falling.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 76</b></p>
<p align="left">Maybe we're going the wrong way...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 77</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac discovered we could actually run. Finally got across 
sandfall.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 78</b></p>
<p align="left">Fighting scary Mars Adepts on aerie to try and save girl with 
weird shaped head.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 79</b></p>
<p align="left">Defeated huge dragon. Felix jumped off lighthouse for girl with 
funny shaped head.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 80</b></p>
<p align="left">Sailing on ship borrowed from some guy. Surrounded by the ocean. 
This is not very fun at all.</p>
