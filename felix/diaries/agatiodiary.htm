<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>Venus Lighthouse was lit. Cool.</p>
<p><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p>I miss Prox. I miss eating snow cones and making snow angels. I miss the 
snow...</p>
<p><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p>Aw, we can't get back to the Western Sea. Bummer.</p>
<p><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p>So, I guess we're just going to piss around and look for Saturos and Menardi?</p>
<p><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p>Where are those guys anyway?</p>
<p><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p>Just noticed, Karst's skirt is really, really short.</p>
<p><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p>Pointed it out to her and she hit me. Ouchies.</p>
<p><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p>If they were going to send us out anyway, why couldn't we have gone with 
Saturos and Menardi?</p>
<p><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p>Ooh, a bunny! Bunnies are cute!</p>
<p><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p>Karst cooked the bunny to eat. How could she?</p>
<p><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p>I am so bored. Hey, that looks like a snowy continent down there. Cool!</p>
<p><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p>Had snowball fight with Karst on Tundaria. It was a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p>I'm hungry. I want cookies!</p>
<p><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p>Wah. Mean lady in bakery ran away screaming when I asked her if she had 
cookies.</p>
<p><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p>Am I that scary? I asked Karst and she said I looked like I was hit with an 
ugly stick. Meanie.</p>
<p><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p>Tried dancing in Izumo, but everyone either ran away screaming or pointed and 
laughed.</p>
<p><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p>Karst yelled at me for making a fool of myself and embarrassing her. She's so 
bossy.</p>
<p><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p>I wish I had some better looking armour. Green is just so icky.</p>
<p><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p>Snot is green. Snot is also gross.</p>
<p><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p>So is dirty water. Kinda. It's all greeny brown and murky. Ew.</p>
<p><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p>Wouldn't a spandex outfit be awesome?</p>
<p><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p>And a cape! I'd like to have a cape, like Saturos did!</p>
<p><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p>Ooh, a sword would be nice too. I don't even have a weapon. How lame am I?</p>
<p><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p>It's just occurred to me, I will never be awesome as Saturos was.</p>
<p><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p>Life just sucks.</p>
<p><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p>What are we even doing?</p>
<p><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p>Did we take a long time to appear in the game or something?</p>
<p><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p>I guess we did, depending on how the game was played.</p>
<p><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p>Karst says I shouldn't be breaking the fourth wall. Screw it.</p>
<p><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p>I want candy!</p>
<p><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p>Okay, Karst is going to get me candy. I'll just sit here and do nothing then.</p>
<p><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p>Karst came back in a homicidal rage. Apparently some guy named Isaac killed 
Saturos and Menardi. Damn.</p>
<p><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p>Now Karst is burning trees and being psychotic.</p>
<p><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p>Is this really how the grieving process works?</p>
<p><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p>Karst, couldn't you just cry instead of screaming and destroying things? 
You're kind of loud.</p>
<p><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p>This Karst is scary. I want the old Karst back...</p>
<p><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p>I swear, that Isaac will pay for turning Karst into this homicidal maniac.</p>
<p><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p>Being a homicidal maniac sounds kind of fun actually. I might try it.</p>
<p><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p>Except there's nobody around to be a homicidal maniac to yet. Drat.</p>
<p><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p>Karst has calmed down a bit but still wants Isaac dead.</p>
<p><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p>She's writing 'DIE, ISAAC' all over the walls in crayon. Crazy bitch.</p>
<p><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p>I sure hope we don't have to pay for it.</p>
<p><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p>And now she's doodling herself smashing stick figure Isaac's face in. I am 
honestly concerned.</p>
<p><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p>Tried to talk Karst out of being psychotic. She threw a mug at me.</p>
<p><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p>Are we ever going to get this whole saving Prox thing done? It's taking too 
bloody long. What is that lazy Felix doing?</p>
<p><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p>We met up with a creepy looking shmuck named Alex, who used to travel with 
Saturos and Menardi.</p>
<p><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p>Now this Alex guy is following us. We're too nice to tell him to piss off.</p>
<p><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p>Huh? My hairgel is missing. Where did it go?</p>
<p><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p>Tried to scare the poo out of Felix and his buddies in Champa. I don't think 
it worked.</p>
<p><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p>Oh yeah, and did I mention Alex insulted us? What a creep.</p>
<p><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p>Asked Karst why that loser is with us. She doesn't know either.</p>
<p><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p>Found my hairgel in Alex's stuff. I am going to kill that bastard.</p>
<p><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p>I tried to, and he made me soaking wet! I don't like being soaking wet...</p>
<p><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p>Asked Karst to kill Alex instead. She said she's saving her homicidal 
tendencies for Isaac. I get the feeling that Karst is a little obsessed with 
this whole idea of killing Isaac. It's normal to be upset about your sister 
dying and want her killer punished, but there's something creepy about this 
whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p>Stuff happened on Jupiter Lighthouse. Not sure why I was fighting Isaac, but 
I was and Karst picked on some short blond kid instead. We failed to kill them, 
so we tried to kill Felix and his buddies too. Failed miserably. Alex even had 
to save us. How embarrassing.</p>
<p><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p>The creepy shmuck left us! Hooray!</p>
<p><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p>Karst seems a little better now, though she's still a bit unhappy about not 
getting to kill Isaac.</p>
<p><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p>We're going back to Prox now. Goody!</p>
<p><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p>I wonder if all that crayon will wash off... maybe nobody will notice...</p>
<p><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p>We're so close to Prox now and we have the Mars Star. Mars Lighthouse should 
be lit very soon and we'll save Prox.</p>
<p><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p>Even Karst is getting a little giddy with excitement. I sure missed the 
normal Karst. Seems like she's back now.</p>
<p><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p>Home sweet home. I'm never leaving Prox again.</p>
<p><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p>We're in Mars Lighthouse now. Admittedly, I feel just a little nervous. It's 
not going to be all that easy, is it? Karst says we'll be fine. I sure hope so.</p>
