<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>Looks like Venus Lighthouse was lit. Awesome!</p>
<p><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p>Agatio and I are looking for Saturos and Menardi... wonder where they might 
be now.</p>
<p><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p>I miss my sister a lot. Sure hope she's okay.</p>
<p><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p>Of course she's fine. She's Menardi.</p>
<p><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p>People keep staring at us. Am tempted to give them the finger.</p>
<p><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p>Or I could set random stuff on fire to scare them.</p>
<p><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p>Stupid Agatio thinks my skirt's too short or something. Ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p>How can he go around wearing that icky looking green armour all day anyway?</p>
<p><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p>I almost feel embarrassed to be seen with that walking fashion disaster.</p>
<p><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p>Agatio is upset that I killed a rabbit to eat. What a dork.</p>
<p><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p>Ooh, we found a snowy continent down south. Nice.</p>
<p><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p>I had forgotten how fun snowball fights were. Whee!</p>
<p><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p>I wonder where my sister could have got to...</p>
<p><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p>Some people are just freaking weird. Like that nutty lady Agatio scared off 
in the bakery...</p>
<p><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p>Agatio really does look like he's been hit with an ugly stick. Not my fault 
it's true...</p>
<p><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p>Why the hell is Agatio dancing? He looks like a drunk yeti trying to hop 
around on one leg backwards.</p>
<p><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p>Yesterday was so embarrassing. I'm never going to Izumo again.</p>
<p><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p>Wandering around like this is getting boring. I feel like burning stuff.</p>
<p><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p>Why does Agatio keep going on about the color green all of a sudden?</p>
<p><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p>Pink is even better than green. Pink is an awesome colour.</p>
<p><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p>Agatio in spandex is NOT a pleasant image.</p>
<p><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p>My outfit is nice, isn't it? I think it is. It's way better than Agatio's 
anyway.</p>
<p><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p>Agatio's now whining about not having a weapon. I love my scythe. Yeah, so I 
copied my sister. So what?</p>
<p><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p>My sister is so cool. I want to be just like her.</p>
<p><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p>I wonder where Saturos and Menardi are. What are they up to now?</p>
<p><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p>It's like they disappeared off the face of Weyard, I swear. And what about 
Felix?</p>
<p><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p>Wow, I haven't even thought about Felix lately. Wonder if he's still being 
emo?</p>
<p><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p>I hope nothing happened to them at Venus Lighthouse...</p>
<p><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p>Sheesh, Agatio's breaking the fourth wall like crazy. Weirdo.</p>
<p><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p>Now Agatio wants candy. Sigh.</p>
<p><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p>Fine, I'll get him that damn candy if it shuts him up.</p>
<p><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p>Menardi... is dead. As is Saturos. Somebody named Isaac killed them.</p>
<p><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p>I am going to KILL Isaac!</p>
<p><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p>Nobody kills my sister and gets away with it.</p>
<p><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p>Isaac is definitely going to pay for what he has done.</p>
<p><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p>I wonder how I should kill Isaac? No matter, so long as he dies.</p>
<p><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p>How could anyone have defeated Saturos and Menardi?</p>
<p><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p>My dear sister... I swear I will avenge you.</p>
<p><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p>So where is that Isaac anyway? I can't wait to find and kill him.</p>
<p><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p>DIE ISAAC!</p>
<p><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p>I've been sharpening my scythe. Can't wait to use it.</p>
<p><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p>So what if I wrote on the walls with crayons? I am expressing my feelings! 
Can't he understand my rage and sadness?</p>
<p><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p>Maybe I did go a little overboard. I don't care. Isaac must die.</p>
<p><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p>Drawing the destruction of stick figures just isn't as satisfying. Woe.</p>
<p><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p>Stupid Agatio doesn't understand. Screw him.</p>
<p><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p>Is this taking really long or what? I'm tired of this.</p>
<p><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p>Met some blue haired guy named Alex who knew Saturos and Menardi. I honestly 
don't give a rat's ass about him.</p>
<p><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p>That Alex guy is still around. Whatever.</p>
<p><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p>Agatio asked me if I had seen his hairgel. So that explains his weird hair 
then.</p>
<p><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p>Met Felix and his pals again in Champa. That Alex is a total loser, he 
insulted us and Saturos and Menardi as well.</p>
<p><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p>What a slimeball that Alex is. How much longer do we have to put up with him?</p>
<p><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p>No, Agatio, I don't know why Alex is with us. Should I?</p>
<p><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p>Agatio is now in a rage about Alex stealing his hairgel. Meh. What a silly 
thing to get angry over. The way he's acting, you'd think his sister was 
murdered.</p>
<p><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p>Mars Adepts and water don't mix. I could have told Agatio that...</p>
<p><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p>Now he's asking me to kill Alex. Sorry, I'm saving it for Isaac.</p>
<p><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p>Wow, I saved up way too much homicidal energy, didn't I? We tried to kill 
pretty much everyone on Jupiter Lighthouse and Alex saved us. Kind of 
embarrassing, really.</p>
<p><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p>So, yeah. I wasn't able to kill Isaac. Bummer. But we have the Mars Star now 
and Alex left, so it's all good.</p>
<p><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p>It's up to us to finish what Saturos and Menardi set out to do. Onward to 
Prox!</p>
<p><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p>It's so good to be going back home at last. I missed Prox.</p>
<p><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p>I wish Saturos and Menardi had been able to come back...</p>
<p><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p>It won't really be the same without them. I miss my sister so much.</p>
<p><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p>Well, at least we get to finish what they started. I bet they are so proud of 
us, wherever dead people go. I can't wait!</p>
<p><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p>Yay, we're home! Time to save Prox!</p>
<p><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p>Agatio's worried that getting through Mars Lighthouse won't be easy. I'm sure 
we'll be fine! We'll save the world, have a big celebration party in Prox and 
I'll write all about it afterwards!</p>
