<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Gah!!! Those Vale elders don't care that our town is on the 
brink of extinction? I should just burn them all for being idiots!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">The others won't let me burn them. Jerks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Instead we're just going to sneak in and steal the Elemental 
Stars? Boring! I want to just go burn those silly elders to a crisp!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Freaking mountain tried to kill us. Only Saturos and I 
survived... but we got to beat up some kids then drag some half-drowned Valeans 
out of the river. Not bad.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Even if we're taking some hostages back, it doesn't change the 
fact a bunch of us died. THIS SUCKS! Burning seagulls is fun...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">That kid keeps vomiting. Ew. I hope his parents clean up after 
him...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Back in Prox... made Saturos go tell them we failed. Am going to 
sit at home with Karst and rant at her about how life sucks. She won't mind.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Whaaaat?! We aren't going out again for THREE YEARS?! Our town 
is close to dropping off the edge! Why would they make us wait three years?!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>3 Years Later</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally, we're going back to Vale. It's just me, Saturos, Felix 
and that snob Alex we picked up near Mercury Lighthouse. Prox wasn't willing to 
lose a bunch more people again...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Those Valean jerks keep staring at us. Yeah, I have red eyes and 
pointy ears. SO FREAKING WHAT?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">3 Elemental Stars and 2 hostages. Well, we did better than last 
time. That Kraden sure talks a lot though...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden is a rambling old man who gets on my nerves. Jenna is 
Felix's sister and a Mars Adept. Apparently she thought he was dead. Geez... it 
was three years, not a decade! Are all Valeans pathetic no-hopers? No wonder 
they don't care the world is shrinking. Or didn't want to believe us. Whatever.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Where's my nail polish gone?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Caught Alex replacing my nail polish. Tried to burn him but he 
warped away. That jerk. Using my nail polish?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Uh... is it just me or is Jenna enjoying travelling? Isn't she 
supposed to be a hostage? Well, at least she's not complaining... that would be 
annoying.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden seems to be having fun too... rambling about crap nobody 
gives a damn about. Ugh.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">That Saturos! He ate the last of the fruit at breakfast! I'm 
getting really cranky...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">... Snow. There is snow everywhere. I... I love snow...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">Stopped at Imil and Alex disappeared. Am tempted to go and have 
fun in snow.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">Maybe I could go and build a snowman when nobody's looking? 
Forget it, I'll just sit here and look pissed off.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">Don't we have something important to do like... lighting Mercury 
Lighthouse? Oh, wait, Alex just came back. About time...</p>
<p><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p>Going through the lighthouse... we're walking on water. How weird is that?</p>
<p><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p>Those brats from Sol Sanctum turned up after we lit the Mercury Lighthouse. 
Got away with Felix, Jenna and Kraden, but Saturos got beaten up. Alex saved 
him. How could those brats defeat him?</p>
<p><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p>Stupid trees were looking at me, I swear they were. Got annoyed and pushed 
them over. What were they doing all stacked up like that anyway?</p>
<p><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p>Ugh. We just had to swim because a bridge wasn't down. Am not impressed.</p>
<p><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p>Tried to burn apes while going through Mogall Forest. They were too fast. 
Rats.</p>
<p><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p>Why do those people in Xian speak funny? It's annoying.</p>
<p><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p>WHERE DID ALEX GO NOW?</p>
<p><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p>I AM GOING TO BURN ALEX TO A SMOULDERING CRISP.</p>
<p><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p>But I think that wouldn't be a good idea. Ugh. STILL PISSED OFF THOUGH.</p>
<p><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p>He finally came back. Now we're going to Altin.</p>
<p><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p>Monster spit? Ew. How did that get there?</p>
<p><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p>When are we going?</p>
<p><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p>All this sitting around and doing nothing is getting on my nerves.</p>
<p><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p>Can't I just burn one person?</p>
<p><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p>I'M BLIND. I AM GOING TO SUE THAT OLD MAN FOR SWIMMING IN A TIGHT SWIMSUIT.</p>
<p><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p>Just realised I don't know how to sue anybody, so got pissed off and made 
boulders block Silk Road instead while going through Altin Crossing. At least it 
might slow those meddling kids down.</p>
<p><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p>Felix, Jenna, Kraden and Alex are complaining the desert is hot. It doesn't 
feel hot to me.</p>
<p><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p>Do they ever stop complaining?</p>
<p><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p>Now we're out... and off to Kalay.</p>
<p><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p>Are you kidding me? The road ahead is blocked so we'll have to take a ship? 
This sucks...</p>
<p><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p>Ship isn't setting off for a while. Tried to console self by shopping for 
clothes. Jenna came along as well. Clothes shopping makes me feel much better~!</p>
<p><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p>These new clothes are great. I feel like going out and buying more already...</p>
<p><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p>Caught Alex looking at my dresses. He fled before I could get answers.</p>
<p><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p>I think Alex may be into cross-dressing. The horror...</p>
<p><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p>Saturos seems troubled. Wonder what that's about...</p>
<p><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p>We're getting low on money. Can't buy new clothes because we need money for 
the ship. Drat.</p>
<p><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p>Ship leaving tomorrow. It's about bloody time.</p>
<p><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p>Am sorely tempted to burn everyone on ship for staring at us...</p>
<p><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p>Kraden's going on about dolphins. Can't I push him overboard and pretend it 
was an accident?</p>
<p><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p>Ship reached Tolbi finally. Am getting really tired of time wasting...</p>
<p><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p>Saturos seems to a bit miffed we can't participate in some Colosso thing.</p>
<p><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p>What's so interesting about a bunch of warriors beating each other up anyway?</p>
<p><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p>What kind of weirdo kidnaps girls to build lighthouses?</p>
<p><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p>He named the lighthouse after himself too? How vain.</p>
<p><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p>I want to try out the Lucky Fountain, but we have no Lucky Medals. What a 
shame...</p>
<p><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p>Apparently Saturos found a Jupiter Adept. Not bad.</p>
<p><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p>And we're leaving Tolbi without even grabbing her. Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p>I hope it's not too far to the next lighthouse... we've wasted enough 
freaking time.</p>
<p><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p>Alex vanished again when we got to Suhalla. Sorely tempted to hunt him down 
and murder him.</p>
<p><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p>Where the HELL is he?!</p>
<p><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p>I am going to go INSANE stuck in this small, boring town!</p>
<p><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p>How have I not burnt the entire place down yet? Am going to go yell at 
Saturos.</p>
<p><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p>People seem to be scared of desert full of tornados. Pfft. Tornados don't 
scare me.</p>
<p><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p>I'd happily go burn down the entire desert... after burning down this town.</p>
<p><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p>Alex came back. MUST NOT BLOW HIM UP.</p>
<p><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p>What?! Now Felix has the flu?!</p>
<p><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p>It's too bad we need Felix for the Venus Lighthouse. We just have to wait for 
him to get better... ugh... so sick of this...</p>
<p><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p>How long does the flu last?!</p>
<p><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p>Apparently Alex can heal the flu, but didn't do so until Saturos asked! That 
creep... he's playing games with us, isn't he?</p>
<p><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p>Tornados stopping us from going through desert. AM REALLY MAD.</p>
<p><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p>I WOULD LIKE TO GET PAST THESE TORNADOS BEFORE NEXT YEAR.</p>
<p><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p>Alex solved problem by soaking tornados. Now we're getting through...</p>
<p><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p>How convenient. That Jupiter Adept fell into our laps. Great.</p>
<p><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p>My hair... it's full of sand. Ew. Must get it all out somehow.</p>
<p><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p>Had fun burning people at the Suhalla Gate. Well, they wouldn't let us 
through!</p>
<p><b>Day 69</b></p>
<p>Saturos thinks I killed people while we were entering Venus Lighthouse. Maybe 
I did go a little overboard...</p>
<p><b>Day 70</b></p>
<p>The entrance's the exit?! Who designed this place?</p>
<p><b>Day 71</b></p>
<p>We have to go to Babi Lighthouse apparently. This is taking so long...</p>
<p><b>Day 72</b></p>
<p>Had to burn even more people while entering Babi Lighthouse. Well, it's their 
fault for trying to prevent us from saving the world.</p>
<p><b>Day 73</b></p>
<p>Alex warped us past weird door. What was up with that door? At least we can 
keep going...</p>
<p><b>Day 74</b></p>
<p>How nice to finally be in the Venus Lighthouse. Felix, Jenna and Kraden were 
left behind and told to go to the ship. Where did Alex go?</p>
<p><b>Day 75</b></p>
<p>Going on through lighthouse, dragging our Jupiter Adept with us... not sure 
why, she isn't that useful right now.</p>
<p><b>Day 76</b></p>
<p>Burned Saturos for saying silly things. So what if we gave Felix the Jupiter 
Star and took the Jupiter Adept?</p>
<p><b>Day 77</b></p>
<p>How much longer is this going to take?!</p>
<p><b>Day 78</b></p>
<p>Finally, we're here, but Saturos wants to stop and chat before we light the 
Venus Lighthouse. Sigh. I'll just write one more entry... it's hard to believe 
we took so long just to get halfway. I look forward to the lighting of Jupiter 
Lighthouse and Mars Lighthouse, then Prox can be saved. Though, I can't help but 
wonder if we will be returning to Prox... I'm not sure why. Of course we will, 
right?</p>
