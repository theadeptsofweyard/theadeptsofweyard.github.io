<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Lost my voice. Well, crud. Now I can only nod and shake my head.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>

<p align="left">Garet stole all the cookies and ate them. Must devise plot to 
kill Garet and get away with it. I don't care if he's my best friend.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Managed to get Felix in on plot. He's sick of Garet trying to 
hit on his sister. Jenna's too busy accidentally burning things to pay attention 
to Garet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Plot ruined. Boulder on Mt. Aleph fell last night and Felix got 
washed away with his parents and my dad. Well, poo. Maybe Jenna will help out.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna too busy being emo.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Mom made more cookies. They tasted like crap. Tried to get the 
point across by stomping on them since I can't talk. She thought I was just 
upset about Dad.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Search called off, everyone who disappeared assumed dead. Lazy 
pessimists.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">I got a writing board to communicate with people since I can't 
talk. Yippee.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>3 Years Later</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet burned me "accidentally" while practicing Psynergy. Must 
make another plan to kill him without getting caught.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Suggested it to Jenna and she burned me too! Am now going to 
destroy Mars Adepts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Cursed Mars Adept. A couple of them robbed Vale, and Felix was 
alive and with them too. Blimey. Jenna and the rambling old sage, Kraden, got 
kidnapped. Would like to have a party, but must go off on world saving quest 
with Garet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Why are we doing what a one-eyed rock tells us to do anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Met scrawny kid named Ivan, telling us his master lost his rod. 
Thought he meant a vasectomy and got hit with lightning. Ouch. Beat up some 
thieves and kid left with rod.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Got stuck in Goma Range and weird kid joined us again. Now 
travelling to Bilibin.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Asked a weird guy with strange accent if we could go stop some 
wacky curse that turns people into trees. He said no.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Busted through Bilibin Barricade. Going to Kolima Forest anyway.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Almost got turned into trees. My, that was frightening. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up some wacky talking tree. I almost busted my spine 
falling through that lousy tree. Hope he pays compensation.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">In cold, snowy place. Brr... too cold. But Garet burned me again 
so it's okay. Ivan fainted again...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached place named Imil and rushed to sanctum to revive Ivan. 
Threatened him and told him I would kill him if he didn't stop fainting.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">Old guy having heart attack or something. Old lady wants us to 
find somebody named Mia.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">Now travelling through Mercury Lighthouse with girl named Mia. 
Must ask her if that's actually blue dye.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">Mercury Lighthouse lit. That shiny blue light was really 
pretty... Mia joining us permanently. This may be uncomfortable.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">Heading back to forest with some magical healing water or 
whatever. Why didn't we just do Mercury Lighthouse first?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Tree stuff sorted out, now heading south.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">Found a temple with some weird starving monk.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">Weird starving monk named Nyunpa kept looking into our minds. 
Ivan was blushing and Mia looked afraid. Very suspicious of new comrades.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">Weird monk made us go into waterfall to get Force or whatever. I 
thought Force was something you didn't own?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, wrong Force. Apparently it's an orb that shoots stuff or 
whatever. Shiny.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">Setting off to Mogall Forest. Asked Ivan why he was blushing 
before. Ivan got very embarrassed and wouldn't tell me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">Lost in Mogall Forest. Must blackmail Ivan to tell me his 
secret.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet thinks we should follow the apes. Stupid Garet. Stole one 
of Mia's panties, put them in Ivan's bag and pretended to catch him in the act.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan terrified, thinks I'll tell Mia he had her panties though 
he doesn't know how they got there. Mia is on warpath to find panties. Garet 
chasing apes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan finally caved in when I said I would tell Mia. He told me 
he had been thinking... certain things about a person. Am very disturbed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Fought some giant ape and got a Douse Drop. Ooh, pretty and 
shiny...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">Put panties in Garet's bag since Mia still wants them back. Mia 
beat Garet senseless. I'm liking Mia even more.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Xian. Garet suspects I put the panties there. This may 
not turn out well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">Did weird stuff with pushing over log. Purple-haired girl 
complained about voices in head and went to find guy named Hsu.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Found girl with psychosis screaming for Hsu at Alpine Crossing. 
I think her name's Feizhi. Whatever.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">Caught Mia dying hair. She'll do anything for me so long as I 
don't tell. This could be fun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Altin is disgusting lagoon of monster spit. Gross.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">Trekking in mines. Riding in carts are fun!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">We're beating up moving statues. How weird is that?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">It's too dark in these stupid mines. Accidentally touched Ivan's 
butt. Ew.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Convinced Ivan it was Garet who touched his butt then told Mia 
Garet did it. Mia seemed to believe me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet pushed me down huge hole. OW.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up some giant statue and got a Lift Gem. Nifty. Now to get 
out of stupid mines.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Monster spit gone. Must go back through mines to get somewhere.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Lama Temple. Met freaky woman named Hama. Seems to know 
Ivan. Weird.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">Found fat dude named Hsu trapped under rocks and helped him for 
no reason at all. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">In hot desert. Garet, Ivan and Mia will not shut up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Tried to drown Garet in oasis because he wouldn't shut up. 
Failed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">Sick of desert, sick of everyone saying same things over. Choked 
Ivan in anger.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">I can't possibly be annoyed at Mia... she's so beautiful and 
sweet and... wait, what?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">Fought giant Manticore and finally out of desert.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Kalay. Must have bath. Sand in pants is irritating me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan's master was kidnapped, but his wife told us to just go on 
our quest. Okay then.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">Wait, what was our quest again?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Asked Ivan, he seems intelligent. Ivan called me an idiot.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">Asked Mia. She says we have to stop lighthouses being lit or 
something.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Asked Garet why we're stopping lighthouses from being lit and he 
hit me. Ow.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">Laughed at Garet for not knowing what an ocean was. He set me on 
fire.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">On ship. For some reason we must protect people on ship from 
monsters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">Freaky jellyfish attacking rowers. Mmm, fried calamari is good.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">Creepy squid thing with tentacles called Kraken tried to violate 
us or something. Killed it dead.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Tolbi. Tolbi boring.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Went to random cave for no reason at all. Found invisible man 
who wants us to get draught for him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">Cave is blooming annoying. Kept tripping over and falling on 
face. Can't see a thing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">Got draught. Hope we don't drop it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet shocked invisible man is really a man. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Got to fight in Colosso thing. Whatever.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">Did well in Colosso. Guy named Iodem travelling with us to Venus 
Lighthouse.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Iodem is annoying and won't shut up. Got own back at him by 
stealing Mia's bra and putting it in his bag.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Backfired. Mia thought Garet put them there. Enjoyed seeing 
Garet beaten.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelling through weird desert full of tornadoes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Tried throwing Ivan at a tornado. Failed miserably.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 69</b></p>
<p align="left">Got chased by huge freaking tornado. Barely got away. Whew.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 70</b></p>
<p align="left">Stupid Garet dragged me back and forced us to fight huge 
freaking lizard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 71</b></p>
<p align="left">Found soldiers beaten up at Suhalla Gate. Something about group 
with no papers. Honestly, I don't blame then. I would have done the same.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 72</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Venus Lighthouse. Entrance is actually exit. Blah.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 73</b></p>
<p align="left">Found real entrance. Finally got to leave Iodem behind.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 74</b></p>
<p align="left">Nearly at aerie... hopefully.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 75</b></p>
<p align="left">Keep falling off annoying sandfall.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 76</b></p>
<p align="left">Still falling off. Maybe there's another way...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 77</b></p>
<p align="left">Hey, didn't know I could actually run!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 78</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached aerie. Tried to get kidnapped girl back and failed. Lost 
rod and fighting scary Mars Adepts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 79</b></p>
<p align="left">After beating huge dragon, Felix jumped off lighthouse with 
kidnapped girl. He's insane.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 80</b></p>
<p align="left">Set sail on ship borrowed from that old guy, Babi. Apparently we 
also have to save his life or something, but this quest is more important... 
whatever it was.</p>
