<p align="center">Ivan's Diary</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">;_; Layana put my hair in curlers again and everybody's teasing 
me and saying I look like a girl and they are so mean! *sob*</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">Somehow accidentally hit the bullies with lightning bolts when 
they were teasing me again. How did I do that?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Hammet grounded me. *sniff*</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Hammet freaking out about some storm that hit a village nearby. 
Whatever.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Decided to ask about real parents. But Hammet and Layana 
wouldn't say anything.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">I, Ivan of Kalay, declare I shall go on a quest to find my true 
parents! Nothing shall stop me!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Am lying in room, bandaged and covered in bruises. Grounded 
again. *sigh* Stupid monsters... and I had only been walking for five minutes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm a little concerned about my height...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>3 Years Later</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">I've only grown an inch in a month. Must... grow... more! But 
how?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">I found a stretching rack in the dungeon... with various other 
torture devices... and some other stuff I didn't recognise. Wonder if I could 
use the rack?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Hammet and Layana forbade me from ever going in the dungeon 
again. I wonder why?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">Going on a trip with Hammet! Woohoo! I'm finally getting out of 
this dull city!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">Hammet's precious rod disappeared and he left me all alone here 
in Vault. ;_; But I got it back from thieves, after two people helped me. Hammet 
went to Lunpa, it seems. Better go there.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Gave up, when people wouldn't let me in, and rejoined with the 
people who helped me- Isaac and Garet. Garet makes me feel really, really 
small... but I'm going to be helping them with their important quest.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Apparently there's a curse going around and turning people into 
trees. I... I'm scared... I don't want to become a tree...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">Would I become taller if I turned into a tree? We're going to 
Kolima Forest...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Nearly became a tree. Isaac owes me for being a reckless idiot.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up freaky talking tree. Garet is such a pig, it's 
sickening...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">x_x Cold... snowy... think I'm going to faint again from that 
Mauler's hit... *thud*</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm saved! We got to Imil and it's still so... cold... brr...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">Looking for a girl named Mia. Where is she anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">Going through Mercury Lighthouse with Mia. Hopping on the water 
sure is fun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">Lighthouse got lit and Mia joined us. She seems like a really 
nice girl... but I'm amazed at her ability to angst for a few seconds then 
simply be all cheerful again...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">What? We're going back to Kolima Forest? This sucks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Sorted out the stuff with trees. Sure glad I never became one...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">Found a suicidal monk starving himself to death in a temple. 
Something about enlightenment or whatever, I suppose...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">The monk is using my Mind Read ability against me! The nerve of 
him! I was very careful not to betray any private thoughts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">Getting Force Orb. I can't wait to see what it does.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh... it's not that interesting. But I'm sure we'll find a use 
for it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">Heading on to forest. Mia seems really happy. I wonder if she's 
hiding something? Isaac told me I was blushing back at temple and asked why. 
Oh... drat...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">Tried reading Mia's mind in sleep during forest trip, but all I 
got were thoughts about maiming that Alex guy. Creepy...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet wants to chase apes. What a weirdo... hey! Why are Mia's 
panties in my bag... and what is Isaac doing?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac threatened to tell Mia her panties were in my bag. I'm 
scared... and Mia seems pretty keen on finding out where the panties went...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally had to tell Isaac guilty secret in fear of Mia. Now he 
knows of my feelings for a certain person. I think I'll just go die now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Got some Douse Drop after fighting a huge ape. Finally out of 
forest.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac framed Garet for the panty theft, am now off hook. Hmm, I 
wonder if I've grown in the past few weeks...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">Don't think I have. *sigh* Reached Xian.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">Saw a girl suffering from psychosis. Poor girl.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">She is at Altin Crossing, screaming for some guy. Wonder if she 
hears his voice in her head too.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm so tired of being short. I wish I could just grow 
overnight...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Being the shortest of the group makes me feel so inadequate... 
telling myself I'm also the youngest doesn't help much.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">Riding mine carts in Altin cheered me up a bit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Uh... okay. First, talking trees, now living statues spewing 
water? What's up with that?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">EW! Someone touched my butt! Who touched my butt?!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac told me it was Garet. That sick pervert... did he know it 
was my butt though? It is very dark in here...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet pushed Isaac down a huge hole. Eh, he deserved it, anyway.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally going to escape dumb mines after getting Lift Gem. I'm 
sick of the dark.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">Going back through mines to go somewhere. So... tired...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Lama Temple, and met a woman named Hama. She seemed to 
know me... and she doesn't feel like a stranger either...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">Helped random guy out from under boulders for some reason.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">Walking through hot desert, will keep saying same things over 
and over for the heck of it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac must be in a bad mood, he tried to drown Garet... *gulp* I 
hope I'm not next.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">Have bruises on throat. Geez, thanks a lot, Isaac!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">Mia is of course exempt to Isaac's wrath.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">Finally got out of awful desert.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">Back home in Kalay, must go and see Layana... after having a 
wash though.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">Hammet was kidnapped for ransom money... oh dear... Layana wants 
us to continue with quest though. Hammet knew about it all along.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">HAMMET IS NOT A EUNUCH! Stupid Garet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet didn't seem to realise the missing rod was actually the 
Shaman's Rod. Wow. He's dense. Isaac is an idiot too. Seems he forgot what the 
quest was...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">Mia agrees that Garet is the biggest moron in the whole of 
Weyard. Well, looks like we have something in common.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac seems rather confused. Are all Valeans this slow?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet didn't know what an ocean was. But... Mercury 
Lighthouse... the ocean was in plain view... I GIVE UP.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">Protecting people on ship from monsters. This is so not fun at 
all.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">The monsters are actually pretty tasty. Yum.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">ACK! TENTACLES! Scary! But killed Kraken monster, so it's okay!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">Reached Tolbi. My legs are wobbly...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">Found an invisible man in a random cave so we're getting draught 
for him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">Stupid cave is far too dark. Why do we have to get it anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">Managed to get it... should have taken invisible man with us, 
left him there with it and had Isaac cast Retreat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">Mia and I were once again shocked by Garet's idiocy. He didn't 
expect the invisible man to be a man?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac has to fight in Colosso for no reason. Glad it's not me.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">On the way to Venus Lighthouse with a man named Iodem.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Does Iodem ever shut up? Mia's bra mysteriously got in his bag. 
For once, I agree with Isaac's actions...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Sadly, Mia blamed Garet, so did not get to see Iodem be beaten 
up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Travelling through freaky desert full of tornadoes. Bizarre.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">Stupid Isaac attempted to throw me at a tornado.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 69</b></p>
<p align="left">Isaac ran away from a huge tornado and dragged us along with 
him. Mia and Garet don't seem impressed. Not sure whose side I should take...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 70</b></p>
<p align="left">Garet made us fight it anyway. Barely survived...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 71</b></p>
<p align="left">Discovered beaten up soldiers by gate. Honestly, who tells scary 
looking Mars Adepts they need papers to go through? Idiots.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 72</b></p>
<p align="left">Got to Venus Lighthouse, but the entrance is actually the exit. 
Uh... okay then...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 73</b></p>
<p align="left">Found real entrance and finally left Iodem behind. Everything is 
so... peaceful... and quiet...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 74</b></p>
<p align="left">I hope we reach the aerie soon...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 75</b></p>
<p align="left">Seem to be having trouble getting across a sandfall...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 76</b></p>
<p align="left">THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY ACROSS THIS STUPID SANDFALL!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 77</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, hey, Isaac found out we could run, so we finally got across 
the sandfall!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 78</b></p>
<p align="left">Fighting the scary Mars Adept on aerie to save girl. She... 
looks a lot like me...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 79</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat them and they fell to their doom, then that girl who looks 
like me fell off the lighthouse. The emo guy with the ponytail jumped after her.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 80</b></p>
<p align="left">Sailing across sea with ship borrowed from Babi. We don't have 
to return it, right?</p>
