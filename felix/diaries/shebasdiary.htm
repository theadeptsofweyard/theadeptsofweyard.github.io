<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p align="left">Felix saved me from drowning after I fell off a lighthouse... he 
is so cool...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p align="left">We're going off on an adventure! Yay!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p align="left">Saw Alex again. He's girly looking and seems like a jerk...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm bored. I think I'll read Jenna's mind in the hope of finding 
out her dark secrets.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p align="left">*whimpers* My hair... I should probably stop using hairspray... 
she <i>burned</i> it!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p align="left">Put cockroaches in Jenna's bag. She didn't even freak out. Crap. 
So much for my grand plan of revenge.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p align="left">Found a new Djinni that's Water elemental. I want a Wind Djinni!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 8</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm not taking that Water Djinni. Only over my dead body!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Mars Djinn are even worse. This annoying one made us chase it 
all over the place...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 10</b></p>
<p align="left">Cool, we found a ship, but we can't take it...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 11</b></p>
<p align="left">Some guy called Piers is in jail, freezing water into ice. Is 
he insane?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 12</b></p>
<p align="left">We're going to Osenia now. Wonder what it's like?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 13</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna is trying to kill Kraden. I'm just glad I'm not the target 
this time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 14</b></p>
<p align="left">This Mikasalla place looks dull. Let's find a more exciting 
place.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 15</b></p>
<p align="left">Cool! Werewolves! Humans that turn into wolves! They exist!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 16</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden is bothering the poor werewolves...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 17</b></p>
<p align="left">Managed to save the werewolves from Kraden. Let's keep him away 
from them for now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 18</b></p>
<p align="left">How does a full moon last so long anyway? I don't get it. And 
Air's Rock seems big...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 19</b></p>
<p align="left">All this sand everywhere is annoying...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 20</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna's getting frustrated. I should keep my distance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 21</b></p>
<p align="left">This rock is really, really big...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 22</b></p>
<p align="left">Still stuck inside this rock... ugh.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 23</b></p>
<p align="left">I got the Reveal Psynergy! Awesome! I can see hidden stuff with 
it!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 24</b></p>
<p align="left">Chatted to some old werewolf named Maha. I got a Jupiter Djinni! 
^_^</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 25</b></p>
<p align="left">At Alhafra now. Got some pointless long cutscene in the process. 
Stupid cutscenes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 26</b></p>
<p align="left">Ew, that Alex is at the inn... why can't he just disappear?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 27</b></p>
<p align="left">Beat up pirates. Cool.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 28</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers's not in Madra anymore. His shiny orb got stolen. We're 
following him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 29</b></p>
<p align="left">Why do we have to sneak through the mountain anyway? Can't we 
just fight our way through?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 30</b></p>
<p align="left">That dog was so cute! ;_; I had to hug it. Now everyone is mad 
at me...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 31</b></p>
<p align="left">Helped Piers get that orb back so we're off back to Madra now!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 32</b></p>
<p align="left">I think Jenna's pissed at me because I told that weird looking 
girl that Isaac killed her sister. And she swore to kill him. Whoops.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 33</b></p>
<p align="left">Blargh. I feel... sick... stupid ship... too bumpy...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 34</b></p>
<p align="left">I'd probably feel sorry for the burnt seagulls if I wasn't 
feeling so sick. Ugh.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 35</b></p>
<p align="left">Piers has a secret alcohol stash on the ship? I've never tried 
that stuff...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 36</b></p>
<p align="left">No fair! They won't let me try it! ;_;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 37</b></p>
<p align="left">So, uh, I'll just pretend I didn't see anything last night when 
I didn't have my head inside a bucket...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 38</b></p>
<p align="left">Kraden banned Felix and Jenna from drinking the alcohol. I think 
that's a good thing... they don't seem to know why...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 39</b></p>
<p align="left">Jenna apparently remembers making out with someone that night. I 
just kept quiet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 40</b></p>
<p align="left">This stupid seasickness... is it ever going to go away? I'm sick 
of throwing up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 41</b></p>
<p align="left">Alright! I think it's getting better, so we're off to Gaia Rock 
now!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 42</b></p>
<p align="left">Oog... I didn't realise that stuff Susa was feeding the serpent 
was alcoholic... did I really take my clothes off?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 43</b></p>
<p align="left">I'm never having alcohol again. My head hurts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 44</b></p>
<p align="left">Done with the rocks. Off to do the Trident pieces now.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 45</b></p>
<p align="left">Wow! I had so much fun playing in the snow before going to 
Tundaria Tower! Snow is so cool...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 46</b></p>
<p align="left">One more Trident piece to go! This wandering around is getting 
tiring...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 47</b></p>
<p align="left">We have all three pieces now, so that's the Trident quest over.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 48</b></p>
<p align="left">The pirate guy escaped, so we're chasing him down to Champa. 
That Alhafran Mayor is a real jerk, by the way.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 49</b></p>
<p align="left">After getting fixed Trident, Alex came and threatened us to 
light the lighthouse with some cronies (including crazy lady who wants to kill 
Isaac) Yikes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 50</b></p>
<p align="left">So... how did all this fog get around Lemuria anyway?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 51</b></p>
<p align="left">Apparently we have to stop the world from shrinking by lighting 
the lighthouses. Let's go do that then.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 52</b></p>
<p align="left">And we're in the Great Western Sea now! Going to Hesperia...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 53</b></p>
<p align="left">Shamans are damn sexist jerks. Wanted to flash-fry them all. 
Well, we got to fight them eventually. It was satisfying.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 54</b></p>
<p align="left">Going to Jupiter Lighthouse. I wonder if I'll find out who I 
am...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 55</b></p>
<p align="left">I didn't get to find out anything about myself... oh, and Isaac 
and his friends joined us... but why haven't I been able to find out about 
myself yet?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 56</b></p>
<p align="left">Now everyone's getting to drink to celebrate... except me and 
Ivan. We shall just calmly observe.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 57</b></p>
<p align="left">Well! That was an interesting party for sure!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 58</b></p>
<p align="left">It would have been nice if they hadn't left the ship a wreck. 
It's finally been cleaned up...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 59</b></p>
<p align="left">And now everyone is picking up the pieces. Garet and Jenna went 
on a crazy rampage, Isaac took off his clothes, Mia threw up everywhere, and 
Piers and Felix made out basically. They should not be allowed to drink alcohol 
at all...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 60</b></p>
<p align="left">Felix seems a bit freaked out. Well, I can understand why...</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 61</b></p>
<p align="left">Ivan's never even got to touch the stuff in his life. Hah. Well, 
I'm not helping him out. It's too unpredictable.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 62</b></p>
<p align="left">Went to Magma Rock and Jenna got some new Psynergy. Blew up wall 
in Loho with new cannon. Cool.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 63</b></p>
<p align="left">Blew up a wall of ice next. How did ice shards not fly 
everywhere and kill us all?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 64</b></p>
<p align="left">Ended up fighting those crazy Mars Adepts in Mars Lighthouse 
that were turned into dragons and they died. Some eye did it... I don't really 
understand.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 65</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, now I do. Saw some one-eyed rock called the Wise One and it 
unleashed a three headed dragon on us at the aerie.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 66</b></p>
<p align="left">Oh, the dragon was Isaac's dad and Felix and Jenna's parents. 
Ouch. Mars Lighthouse got lit, so we're going to Vale soon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 67</b></p>
<p align="left">Off to Vale now. I'm sure it's a nice place. I can't wait to see 
it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Day 68</b></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;A sunken village? How disappointing. I got to tease Garet 
and get away with it. That was fun.</p>
