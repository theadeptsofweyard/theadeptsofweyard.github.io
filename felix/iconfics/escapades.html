<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> I LIKE COFFEE!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Blegh. Coffee tastes nasty.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> *gasp* Did you just... insult coffee?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> o_o;; Calm down, Mia...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> It must be that time of the month. *sigh*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Or the coffee made her insanely psycho for some reason.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Guys, I'm bored. Can't we go on another adventure?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Unless some guy pops out of nowhere declaring his intent to take over the 
world, nope.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I wonder what happened to Alex...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> The Wise One probably killed him and hid the body.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Good. Alex was EVIL! EEEEEEVIIIIIILLLLLLL!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> We get the picture.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> We don't need to go on an adventure. We could take a vacation.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Ooh! Vacation! I want to go on a vacation!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> That doesn't sound like a bad idea.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Let's go to Tolbi and eat pizza. I like pizza.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Uh... no thanks.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Babi's dead, you know. There's nothing to be afraid of.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, I know, but I still don't like Tolbi.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Since it's my idea, I'm going to pick.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> There's no need to be bossy... I'm sure we can all decide on a place to 
go together.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I'd like to go to Contigo.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I was thinking I'd like to see Lemuria. How come we never had a scene if 
we go there in the second game anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> I want to go to Apojii Islands! It must be so nice and warm there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I'd like to go to Kalay and see what it's like.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I think we should go to Xian. That kung fu stuff sounds fun.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Your fire Psynergy is bad enough. I don't want you learning kung fu.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> *pouts* I'm not going to hurt anyone...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Well, there's lots of places in Angara I haven't seen. I wouldn't mind 
seeing one of them.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> TOLBI!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Lemuria!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Apojii!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Contigo!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Xian!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Kalay!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Can't we just pick one place?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Sigh... okay, how about drawing straws?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> BOO!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh no... what do you want now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> We have a problem. It seems Alex survived the collapse of Mt. Aleph. I 
can't find his corpse anywhere.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> No... no... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Look on the bright side, Mia, you still have a chance to violently murder 
him.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Oh, I do, don't I? Hooray!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hey, whatever happened to travelling to random places?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> It looks like our vacation plans are being put on hold...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> So what do you want us to do?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> I simply want you to hunt him down and find out what he's up to.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> And why can't you do it yourself?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> ... I can't. I need to watch Mt. Aleph in case it explodes again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Really?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> Yes, really. Um... see ya! *disappears*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> ... So, how about that picking straws thing then?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> We'll pick the choice of whoever draws the longest straw.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Umm... have you forgotten the Wise One's request already?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> What the heck is a Wise One?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I dunno. Ivan must be like, crazy or something.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> *sigh* I see...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> *muttering* And I was looking forward to murdering him violently.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Here are the straws. Now go ahead and pick.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Alright, I got the longest straw! I can't wait to get a suntan!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oh boy, I'm looking forward to seeing Jenna and Mia sunbathing on the 
beach. Heheheheheheheh...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> On second thoughts, let's draw again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Seriously?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> At this rate, we'll never get anywhere.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> ... Is there a reason you didn't mention me, Garet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Oh dear.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Um, er, you know what? Forget I said anything..<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> No! I won't forget it! Are you saying I'm not attractive?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Goodness, Sheba, you are touchy today...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Okay, let's get to Apojii already.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts teleport away to Apojii*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Ohh... It's so warm.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Is this really a good idea? I mean, Alex...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Forget about him, Ivan. It's about time we had a vacation.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Let's go to the beach! I bet I can build the biggest sandcastle!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Huh, what's a sandcastle?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Y-you don't know what a sandcastle is?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> We never even had time to build sandcastles on the journey.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> I think it's a castle made out of sand. I've never seen one though.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Wow... you poor things...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Lemuria has cliffs on all sides, and we don't even seem to have any 
beaches there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> It's always so cold and there's snow everywhere for miles back home.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Huh, look at that hula dancer over there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> What's with the pink hair? Weird.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> O_O<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> She seems to be startled by our presence.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Um, isn't that a guy?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Er... hello?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> !!! *runs away*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Uh, what just happened there?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> What a strange person. Come to think of it, he seemed rather familiar.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> I think I would remember meeting a pink-haired man in a hula skirt before.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Wasn't the way he ran off a bit suspicious? I think we should follow him.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Maybe he's just shy?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Or he's embarrassed about being seen in a skirt. Maybe he's been forced to 
wear it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> There's definitely something suspicious about him. I agree wih Garet, 
let's chase him.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*They chase after the pink-haired man and soon find him 
trying very badly to hide behind a palm tree*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hey, we can see you, you know.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Eep.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> How come you're running from us?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Uh...?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Is it because you're wearing a skirt?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> O_o ... Er, yes. It's very embarrassing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> So, why are you wearing one?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Because... I lost a bet. So I have to wear it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Is your hair naturally that colour?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Y-yes! I've had pink hair my whole life! Honest!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Calm down. We're not interrogating you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Forgive me for asking, but have we met before? I think you seem kind of 
familiar.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> I've never seen any of you before!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> (muttering to Sheba) Hey, maybe you should read his mind. Something seems 
off.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> (muttering back) Okay, I'll use the long range mind reading skill I 
demonstrated on Venus Lighthouse that for some bizarre reason I have not been 
able to use again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> So, if you have nothing else to ask, I'll- ACK!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> *gasp* It's Alex!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" />: Oh crap! *warps out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Wow, I can't believe we fell for that paper thin disguise.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> He's hardly the master of disguises.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Geez, I wonder what he'll try next. Some crappy mask that only covers up 
one eye?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Should we chase after him? We were going to do the exact opposite of that 
but ended up finding him after all...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> As much as I want to kill him, I really want to sunbathe.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> The Wise One only wanted us to find out what he was up to anyway. We'll 
just tell him Alex was hula dancing in Apojii.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Is he even going to believe us?</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts head down to the beach. Alex returns and 
watches from a distance.*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> What are they doing? I wonder if this is a trap. 
They probably intend to lull me into a false sense of security then when my 
guard is down, they will capture me and haul my ass to the Wise One. Well, I'm 
not falling for it. I'll scare them away from Apojii... with the vilest human 
being known to mankind! *laughs maniacally*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I could swear I just heard somebody laughing maniacally.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> It's just your imagination, Ivan.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> So this is how you make a sandcastle. Amazing!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> I wonder how long it will take for me to tan?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I still can't believe how close we are to Gaia Falls. How were the people 
of Apojii not worried?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> They are amazingly apathetic, aren't they?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Bah! What's with this random banter? I'm leaving, but I'LL BE BACK! 
*warps out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Now I heard someone declare they will be back...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh, it's just Alex. Ignore him.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Is he seriously watching us? What a weirdo.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Pink is a really fitting hair colour for him, now that I think about it.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*Some time later, Alex returns with the "vilest human 
being known to mankind", who is tied up and gagged*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Heh heh heh... this will drive them away from 
Apojii, no doubt about it! Wait, what are they doing?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Hooray! Conga lines are fun!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hey, Felix, come and dance in the conga line with us!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> No. Conga lines are stupid.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Please be careful not to step on my sandcastle. I am going to build the 
biggest and best sandcastle anybody has ever seen.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> You're right, Sheba, this is fun. It's nice to have friends to do these 
sorts of things with...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Gee, you're not going to get sentimental, are you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Shuffle, step, kick. Shuffle, step, kick. I think I got it...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> We're having such a great time. I knew coming here was a good idea. ^_^<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> No, no it was not. *unties the "vilest human being known to mankind" and 
tosses him onto the beach.*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" /> *cough, cough* Goodness me! I have just had to endure one of the most 
horrifying experiences of my life! This is most appalling! How dare they treat 
me, the great Mayor of Alhafra, in such a terrible way! I shall not stand for 
this preposterous behaviour!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Oh no... what's he doing here?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Um, who is that? Okay, I got that he's the Mayor of Alfalfa-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Alhafra, and he's an obnoxious jerk.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I can't believe this!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Let's get out of here before he sees us.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" /> Oh, is that you, Felix? I know I threatened to put you in jail even though 
you did absolutely nothing wrong but perhaps we could strike a deal. If you do 
not help me make my way back home, I can assure you you will regret it-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> That's really not the way to ask for help.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I'm out of here! *runs like hell*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Wait for me! *follows*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Ugh, I can't stand being around that creep! *goes after them*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Can't I finish building my sandcastle?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Ugh. First Alex, now some weirdo... I've had it with this place. I can't 
suntan with all this going on.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, let's go somewhere else.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Heh heh. Just as planned!</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts regroup very far away from the beach*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> *sob* Sandcastle!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Okay, we'll draw straws again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Alright, I got the longest straw! Pizza, here I come!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Oh no... I hate Tolbi. T_T<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> It's okay, Sheba. Babi's dead, remember?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, but... T_T</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*They teleport to Tolbi to see a scene of mass panic. 
Tolbians are running n the street screaming while zombies lurch around moaning 
about brains*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Uh...?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Why is the town overrun by zombies?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> To say this is not what I was expecting is a major understatement.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Just what happened here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Isaac! You're here!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Iodem... what's going on?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> ZOMBIES!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, we can see that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Shouldn't we be doing something? Like killing the zombies?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Don't worry. Talking is a free action.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> Well, see, the alchemy sages were trying to revive Lord Babi.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Why on earth would you want to revive that evil kidnapping bastard?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> It might be possible not everyone thinks he's an evil bastard.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Well, he's still a kidnapper!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> The experiment went horribly wrong and Babi was resurrected as a zombie. 
Oh look, here he is now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/babi.gif" width="32" /> Braaaaaiiiiinnnnns...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Can't zombies say anything other than 'brains'?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Apparently not.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> Please, Lord Babi, come back to your senses. Don't you remember me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/babi.gif" width="32" /> BRAINS. *jumps on Iodem*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Oh boy, I've wanted to do this for a long time. *smashes mace into Babi's 
skull, killing him*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> Nooooooooooooooooo! Lord Baaaaaaaabiiiiiii!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh, for Iris's sake... he was a freaking zombie! He was going to bite a 
chunk out of you!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/iodem.gif" width="32" /> *sobs hysterically* No... my one true love... WHY?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> ... Okaaaay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Now let's kill some zombies.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The next hour or so is spent slaying zombies. After a 
long, tiring zombie slaying session, everyone leaves Tolbi.*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> ;_; I didn't even get to have any pizza.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Time to draw straws yet again...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Alright! I got the longest straw this time!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> So, Kalay then? It's been a while since I've seen Master Hammet...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> It would be a good idea to go then, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*Everyone walks to Kalay and they head up to the palace. 
They are barely inside when they hear shouting.*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/ladylayana.gif" width="32" /> How could you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/lordhammet.gif" width="32" /> I'm really sorry, Layana.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ladylayana.gif" width="32" /> YOU GAVE ME THE CLAP!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/lordhammet.gif" width="32" /> Not so loud...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ladylayana.gif" width="32" /> I've told you time and time again to be careful with your concubines!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> He has concubines?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I really did not need to know Layana has gonorrhea...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I should have stayed in Apojii with my sandcastle.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Forget pizza. I don't think I could eat anything right now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Oh boy. So Hammet got into some concubine trouble again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Huh?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> And he was supposed to be extra careful after that chlamydia scare.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> ... Do we want to know?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> A concubine tried to give Hammet chlamydia as part of some revenge plot, 
but another concubine heard her talking about it and tattled.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Revenge? Whatever for?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Oh, her sister used to be one of Hammet's concubines, but then got 
poisoned and died, so the concubine blamed Hammet for it or something. I'm 
betting Layana just had a fit of jealousy when Hammet called her the "best 
concubine ever".<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Huh, being a concubine sounds kind of exciting.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> ... I really hope you aren't being serious.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> It's not that great, honestly. A lot of the concubines apparently end up 
being disillusioned. But if you really want to be one, I can always put in a 
good word with Hammet.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Jenna is not going to be a concubine. -_-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Who died and made you king? I'll be a concubine if I darn well want to!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> This conversation is getting too weird.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Well, if you do become one, just don't try to be the best. Layana might 
kill you or something. Seriously, she's scary like that. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Doesn't Hammet mind?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Why would he? He's got his own wife and lots of concubines to sleep with. 
It's not like he's going to miss out on anything.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> That's terrible.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Anyway... I think seeing Hammet isn't a good idea right now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, we'll just look round Kalay for a bit, then go somewhere else.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*Eventually, the Adepts leave Kalay.*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Okay, time for more drawing straws.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I got the long straw this time. Let's go to Xian!</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*In Xian...*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> It's been a while since we were last here. Maybe 
we should have some of that nice Xianese cuisine.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I still don't feel like eating...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Gosh, Lady Layana really killed your appetite, didn't she?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Next time he eats too much food, we'll just send him to Kalay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I would quite like to check that dojo out.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Are you really going to learn kung fu?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Would you rather I became a concubine?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> ............................<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Enough concubine talk, already.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> It seems like everywhere we go, something strange happens. Will it also 
be the case in Xian?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Anyway, let's go inside. I just want to take a look.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*They enter the dojo*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/masterfeh.gif" width="32" /> Okay, please be honest, does my nose look too big?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Are you kidding? I'm so glad I didn't inherit that nose.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/hsu.gif" width="32" /> At least you're not fat. *sob* I'M SO FAT!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Uh, anyway, how come you're asking, Father?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterfeh.gif" width="32" /> I'm thinking of getting a nose job.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> ... What.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/hsu.gif" width="32" /> ;_; Nobody loves me!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Um, hello?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Are we the only normal people in the whole of Weyard?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> It's sure starting to seem like it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Oh my gosh! Isaac!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Hey, Isaac, did I ever tell you about something that happened in 
Champa...?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Uh, I don't think so.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Oops. We totally forgot to give him that ring.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> We'll just blame it on Kraden.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> You came for me! *throws herself upon Isaac*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> ACK! HEEEEEELLLLP!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> What... is going on?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> What's this about Champa and a ring?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> I'm so happy! My love! We are together at last!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/hsu.gif" width="32" /> *sobs* Feizhi's heart has been stolen. I want to die.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterfeh.gif" width="32" /> What is going on here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Alright, that's enough. *peels Feizhi off Isaac* Get a grip. He didn't 
come here for you!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> What?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Someone better start explaining right now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> But... but... didn't you get the gift I made for you? That old man said 
he would give it to you and tell you how I felt!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, it's all Kraden's fault!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Then, you don't have feelings for me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Sorry, no.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/hsu.gif" width="32" /> Yes! I still have a chance! *dances for joy*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Isaac is so much more handsome than you. I will never love another man 
again! *runs into other room and slams door*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh dear...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Don't worry, I'm sure she'll get over it sooner or later.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterfeh.gif" width="32" /> So... I assume you lot didn't come solely to break my daughter's heart...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Actually, I think we'll be going now. I'm not really so keen on learning 
kung fu at the moment.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Why must crazy things happen wherever we go?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Off we go again then. I'm starting to get a little tired of this. Can't 
we stay in one place?</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts leave Xian*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> So, only two places left, right? Isaac wants to go 
to Lemuria and Ivan wants to go to Contigo. How about tossing a coin?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I call heads!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I'm sure nothing strange could be happening in Lemuria.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> *flips coin* It's heads.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> So we're going to see Lemuria? How nice.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Honestly, it's not all it's cracked up to be.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, don't expect anything amazing.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*They head to Lemuria*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> What the...?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> My eyes! They burn!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> THIS is what Lemuria is like?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> No, no, I assure you, this isn't normal! Never in my life have I seen 
anything like this...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Ugh... my eyes are shrivelling.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> So, Piers, you have no idea why everyone is walking around... naked?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Absolutely not!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Should we just leave and go to Contigo instead?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I don't think I'll be able to eat ever again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I want to know what's going on. Let's go the palace and see King Hydros.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Is he... going to be naked too?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Naked King Hydros. A sight I've always wanted to see. -_-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I feel sick.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts head into the palace and enter the throne 
room.*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/kinghydros.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Piers, welcome back!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> So, he's naked too...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Look at that potted plant! Isn't it amazing?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yes, what a wonderful potted plant.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I agree.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Why are you all naked?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kinghydros.gif" width="32" /> Well, it's no secret that life in Lemuria is really boring. I came up 
with an idea to try and spice things up a bit. We are all going to be naked and 
revel in the art of the human body. Why don't you try it, Piers?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> NO.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> So now you're going to be a nudist colony?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I don't think I want to come here again... and everyone else probably 
feels the same.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kinghydros.gif" width="32" /> There's nothing wrong with being naked. It feels quite nice. Haven't you 
ever just once wanted to feel the wind blowing over your wang?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> That's it. We're leaving.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts very quickly leave Lemuria and head to 
Contigo.*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Well, everything looks pretty normal here.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Thank goodness for that. This day has been crazy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> It's like some kind of crazy conspiracy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I wonder if my sister is here. Let's check her house.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> Oh, hello, Ivan.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I presume nothing weird is happening here.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> You wouldn't believe the day we've been having.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I don't think we should share the details...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> You were in Apojii, weren't you? I am having visions of a man being 
sacrificed by Apojiians right now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Oh really? I didn't know they were into sacrifices.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> Well, it seems he is quite an odious man and his annoying qualities have 
driven them to such measures.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> It must be the Alhafran Mayor. Serves him right.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Why was he in Apojii in the first place anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Come to think of it, wasn't he saying something about wanting us to get 
him back home? I think he didn't come to Apojii of his own will.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> But then how...?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Alex! He did it, didn't he?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Why would he bring the mayor over to Apojii?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> To drive us away of course! He obviously didn't want us there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> And so, by leaving Apojii, we ended up doing exactly what he wanted.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Wow, we're good at that, aren't we?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Alright, we're going back to Apojii and we're going to teach him a lesson 
he'll never forget.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*The Adepts hurry back to Apojii*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> *is lying on a deckchair on the beach in swimming 
trunks and sipping from a glass* Ahh... this is the life. Who needs ultimate 
power? I'm better off just spending my days sunning myself on the beach. It's so 
nice... and that vile man's dying screams make excellent background music.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> So there he is... that evil jerk. I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Wait. It would be useless to approach him directly.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> He can just warp away after all.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Even if we tried ambushing him, he might fight us off.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Right. He did get a dose of the Golden Sun's power after all so I imagine 
he's quite powerful.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> So we're going to have to be sneaky if we want to punish him. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Exactly how are we going to punish him anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Maybe we can't do it ourselves. We need someone more powerful than Alex 
himself.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Like... the Wise One?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> So we'll somehow kidnap him and get him over to that floating rock? 
Okay... but how?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I can cast Sleep and pray that it works.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I'll help too.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexphair.gif" width="32" /> Heh, and I don't even have to worry about those losers. No way they will 
be coming back here after what happened. I'm free to live out the rest of my 
days in this peaceful place without rocks or annoying Adepts bothering me. What 
a joy. Huh, why is it raining sheep? I feel... sleepy... zzzzzzzzzzz...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Good job. Now let's get him to the Wise One.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">*At the ruins of Mt. Aleph*</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> Oh, so you found him, did you? Good work... but 
why is his hair pink?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> We think it was supposed to be some kind of bad disguise.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Can I kill him?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Okay, Mia, he might be a manipulative jerk, but I know you're not capable 
of murder.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> *pouts* I could be capable of murder.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> You're kinda scaring me... o_o;<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Uh, anyway, what are you planning to do with him, Wise One?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> Heh heh heh... you don't want to know...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> We... don't? o.0<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Well, I just hope he suffers painfully for ruining our vacation.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> This has just been the craziest day ever.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" width="32" /> Well then, I'll be taking Alex, and we're going to have some fun. Oh 
yes... *cackles maniacally and warps out with Alex*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> That rock is really weird. Okay, what's next?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I think I just want to go home and forget about this ridiculous day.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Me too.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> I'm done with travelling for now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Looks like it's really the end of our vacation then. Oh well... hopefully 
the next one will be better.<br />
