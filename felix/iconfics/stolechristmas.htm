<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">*Vale* (A few days before Christmas)</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, it's 
that time of year, huh?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay, 
Christmas! Wait, do we even celebrate Christmas in Weyard?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, probably 
not. Weyard isn't actually Earth...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh, who 
cares? We get to eat turkey!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sigh... I 
know what I would like as a Christmas present.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Cheer up. 
Christmas isn't the season for angsting! It's the season to be merry!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But... I 
still don't even know who my family is...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Want a 
Christmas cookie, Sheba?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh, a 
cookie! *eats it* Yummy! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Cookies make 
everything better. ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I heard 
Kraden was going to dress up as Santa. What is a Santa?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Some old 
dude who wears red and gives out presents apparently.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Every night 
he breaks into people's houses through the chimney and leaves presents.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How the heck 
can he fit through a chimney?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And he even 
has a bunch of flying reindeer to fly him around.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That 
sounds... utterly ridiculous.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Which 
is why only little kids believe in him. He's not even real.<br>
<img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? 
Santa's not real?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What are you 
doing here?<br>
<img src="../../icons/aaron.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> WAH! *runs 
away crying*<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That was 
random.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not in 
the mood for randomness. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Geez! Don't 
be emo!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not emo! 
I'm just cold... and I want to be inside... in front of a nice fire...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, it is 
a bit cold, isn't it? We should go inside instead of standing around like this.<br>
<br>
*Prox* </p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. 
Christmas. What's the big deal about it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know! 
What is it even supposed to be about anyway?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whatever 
this Christmas thing is, it's clear everyone's going to be getting merry.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bah. How 
dare they be merry while we're dead... wait, are we dead?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't 
think too hard about it, Agatio.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
think Agatio's ever had to worry about thinking too hard.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those 
pathetic brats will be clustering around their trees, opening presents, singing 
songs, eating delicious turkey...<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bleh. I 
prefer chicken.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They even 
go to the trouble of decorating the trees. It's completely ridiculous!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And all we 
can do is sit on our butts and lament about the fact Camelot killed us off.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's just 
so unfair. Do those kids even care about the fact they killed us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Probably 
not.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They get to 
live their lives, grow up, get married, have children, grow old and die... and 
we have nothing!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Being dead 
sucks so much!<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Still... we 
can't do anything about it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't 
we teach them a lesson?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, what 
do you have in mind?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We'll 
steal Christmas from them!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... What? 
o.0<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Have you 
lost your mind? How are we supposed to do that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's 
simple. We'll take away all their trees and decorations and presents and the 
turkey too.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It sounds 
insane... but great. Count me in!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... 
sure, why not? o_o<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We don't 
have anything better to do after all.</p>
<p align="left">
*Vale - Christmas Eve*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay! It's 
the day before Christmas! I'm so excited! Have you seen all the presents under 
the tree?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you do 
have a big family. Speaking of your family, how's your brother?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, it's 
fine. I just told him Ivan was a pathological liar.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... You did 
what?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How can anyone 
believe in a fat man who fits down chimneys and has flying reindeer?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They are 
kids, Mia. If you told them the moon was made of cheese, they would believe you.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? The 
moon's not made of cheese?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, there 
goes your dream of travelling to the moon and eating it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, come on, 
Garet, you didn't really believe that, did you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er... uh... 
no, of course not! I was just kidding! Hahahahahaha... sigh...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It might 
just be me, but does anyone feel like we're being watched?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... no?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't feel 
it either.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh, I guess 
it's just me then.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I sure hope 
we're going to have a peaceful Christmas. After all this hard work, we don't 
need anyone causing trouble.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. 
Hopefully Alex won't rise from the dead tomorrow.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are we even 
sure he's dead?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Or maybe 
he'll rise as a creepy zombie and try to eat our brains.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't say 
such freaky things, Jenna...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Your 
imagination is terrifying.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't worry. 
If Alex rises from the dead, I'll send him back quickly.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, yeah... 
you do that...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't wait 
to eat turkey, with gravy and bread sauce, and roast potatoes, and delicious 
Christmas pudding...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Someone's 
hungry.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's about 
lunchtime now, isn't it? Why don't we go and raid someone's house now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We'll raid 
my house this time. Mom went shopping this morning.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Our parents 
must be getting tired of this...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, I 
think mine are... but my mom loves to cook for people anyway.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And my 
parents don't exactly appreciate having extra mouths to fill.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow... you 
guys know how to make us feel wanted...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure 
they didn't mean to hurt our feelings.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's just 
go eat already!<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
*Somewhere close by*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heh heh. 
Those brats have no idea we're here.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is 
surely going to be a piece of cake.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When they 
realise Christmas is gone, they will be so miserable. I can't wait to see their 
sad faces.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That Garet 
kid will cry buckets when he sees the turkey is gone.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Muahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p>
<p align="left">
*Vale* (Night)</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, we're 
going to sneak into every single house and suck everything up into a vacuum 
cleaner?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We have 
some very big vacuum cleaners. And they even run on batteries.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This doesn't 
make any sense.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Karst, none 
of this makes any sense.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, I 
suppose you're right.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heh heh... 
this is going to be good.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's a 
great way to waste our time for sure.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, 
let's get to it.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't know 
how I'm going to be able to sleep tonight... =/<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll sleep 
just fine.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aren't you 
excited about Christmas?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh... I 
just want it to be over already.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Seriously? 
But it's exciting! We get presents! And... um, turkey!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's so 
great about turkey? And we can get presents on birthdays anyway.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... 
come on... Christmas is cool...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Christmas is 
humbug. *pouts*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's a 
humbug? o.0<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I'm not 
sure actually.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o_0 Man, 
you're weird... whatever... I'm going to bed. Goodnight! *leaves*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> All this 
decorating and buying presents... it's so annoying. I don't want to do this 
again. Why am I talking to myself? *goes to bed*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Argh! That 
Saturos... what was he thinking, making us all wear Santa costumes? Idiot... *is 
currently sucking up everything at the inn*<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't feel 
like sleeping... huh? Santa?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yikes!<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> o.o Um... 
what are you doing with the Christmas tree?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, er... 
it's broken and I was just going to fix it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And what's 
with that huge sack like thing?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's, er, 
for carrying broken Christmas trees in. I'm currently fixing them and I'll bring 
them back soon.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right. I 
don't believe you, but whatever. I'm going back to bed. *goes upstairs*<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What a 
strange kid... oh well. *continues to suck everything away*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Zzzzz...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! Wake 
up!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh? Sheba? 
What are you doing here?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not 
Sheba. I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is a 
joke, right?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, it's 
not. I have come to show you your past. *takes Felix's hand and they warp out*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is 
this?!</p>
<p align="left">
*Scene changes to some random room. A younger Felix is sitting at a desk and 
looking very bored.*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meh. I am so 
bored. This is boring.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *bounces in* 
Hey, Felix!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Jenna?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have great 
news!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Do you have 
to exclaim so much?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I do it 
because I'm happy! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And I've got 
great news. Dad said you could come home. Isn't that awesome?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, that's 
nice.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, so 
let's go! *leaves with Felix*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, what? 
What the heck is this?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... your 
past?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I don't 
remember any such scene like this.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... er... 
well, why don't we go back now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, what is 
going on?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *warps Felix 
back to his room* Two more ghosts will be coming for you. The next one will come 
in an hour.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> M-more?! But 
I just want to sleep!<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Too bad. It 
serves you right for being an emo anyway. *disappears*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'M NOT EMO! 
Why does everyone think I'm emo? ._. *tries to go back to sleep*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! Wakey 
wakey!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ugh... 
Jenna, what do you want?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm the 
Ghost of Christmas Present.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Presents? We 
can't open them yet...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, <i>
Present</i>! As in, right now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sigh... is 
this some crazy joke?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Come on, 
let's go! *grabs Felix's arm and they warp out*</p>
<p align="left">
*The scene changes to Isaac, Garet, Ivan, Mia, Jenna, Sheba and Piers sitting 
around a table for Christmas lunch*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This turkey 
is every bit as delicious as I thought it would be. *belches*<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet, don't 
be such a pig.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's too bad 
Felix couldn't be with us for lunch.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. 
Apparently he's being emo and thinks Christmas is er... what was it, humble bug?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Humble bug? 
That makes no sense.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think you 
mean humbug.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, that's 
it! I mean, what is a humbug supposed to be?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe 
Felix's just in the habit of making up words.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If he ever 
shows up, we should ask him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's too bad 
he had to be so emo today. I'm sure he would have liked this lunch.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, who 
cares? It just means more turkey for me.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You don't have 
to sound so mean about it...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If Felix 
wants to be emo, it's his problem.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, we'll 
just enjoy ourselves without him.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is a pity 
though...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wouldn't 
hurt to save him some leftovers, maybe.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I really do 
wish he was here...</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... I'm 
apparently going to miss Christmas lunch tomorrow?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, that's 
what you just saw, isn't it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I'm not 
even planning to miss it!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, it's 
about time we went back now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I bet it's 
just another fake scene...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But can you 
really be sure? Can you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... I don't 
get it. I don't get any of this. Is this some crazy dream?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not a 
dream. Absolutely not. Don't think that.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep... if 
you say so.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, let's 
go! *warps them back to Felix's room* The last ghost will be coming soon.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-what? But 
I don't want to see any more ghosts. ;_;<br>

Mia? Why are you here?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you get 
hit by that freaky mute thing that got me and Isaac?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *narrows eyes 
and shakes head violently*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you the 
Ghost of Christmas... uh, Future?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *nods*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not very

<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't 
believe we're still celebrating Christmas.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Christmas? 
Oh... right. I started calling it Turkey Day.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't you eat 
turkey at other times of the year?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not this 
much, no.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's hard to 
be merry this year...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sighs* I 
don't feel like celebrating anything.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Neither do 
I... why did we even bother?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If only he 
was still with us...<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's not 
talk about it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... he 
wouldn't want us to be sad at Christmas, would he?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why did he 
have to be so emo? If he wasn't emo, maybe...<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just love 
the stuffing. It's delicious.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We get it, 
Garet. You like the food. Now shut up about the food already.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is the 
worst Christmas lunch ever.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're 
right...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why did we 
even bother?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess we 
had nothing better to do...</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder who 
they are talking about. Maybe Kraden kicked the bucket. Wait, Kraden's not emo.<br>

hand again and warps once more*</p>

cemetery?<br>

<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Cemeterys 
are creepy! Why did you bring me here? It's scary.<br>

are we here? Is there something you want to show me?<br>

a gravestone and points at it*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh? *takes 
a closer look at the gravestone and sees his name on it* ACK!<br>

the room a minute later* Felix, what are you screaming about?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I had a 
scary dream! These ghosts were visiting me and they looked like you and Mia and 
Sheba, and Mia tried to kill me, and-<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Uh, 
okay. I don't need to know all the details. *goes to window and opens curtains* 
Oh, it's morning now. Great!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was 
really scary!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> PRESENTS! 
*bounces out of room*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not in 
the mood for presents after that freaky dream...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> AAAAAHHHHHH!!!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now what? 
*goes after her*<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The tree's 
gone! And the presents! And the decorations! Everything's gone!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What...? Why 
would anybody take our things?<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *runs to the 
kitchen and comes back* The turkey! It's gone too!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is 
ridiculous. I wonder if it's happening anywhere else?</p>
<p align="left">
*Everyone later groups in the plaza*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Somebody 
raided every house in the village, stealing every Christmas related thing they 
could find.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's just so 
barbaric. Why would they do that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sob* The 
turkey... I was looking forward to eating it...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. I just 
remembered, I went downstairs last night to see Santa hauling away the Christmas 
tree.<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What?! Why 
didn't you say anything?<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, he said 
he was fixing trees or something, and I didn't think he was raiding the entire 
village.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So Santa 
stole Christmas? But Santa isn't real!</p>
<p align="left">
*Several Vale children hear Piers and run away crying*</p>

someone dressed up as Santa...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And went 
around the village stealing everything? How could they possibly manage to take 
everything?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This whole 
Christmas thing is ridiculous anyway. Let's just forget about it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No way! I 
want my presents!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And I want 
my turkey!<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What can we 
do? Everything is gone...</p>

*On top of Mt. Aleph*</p>

be in despair right now.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We took 
every little Christmassy thing we could find. They don't have anything left to 
celebrate Christmas with.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We well and 
truly stole Vale's Christmas! *cackles*<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And we've 
got so much turkey.&nbsp; We could keep everyone in Prox fed for years with all 
that turkey.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why are we 
standing on the top of Mt. Aleph?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... I 
honestly don't know.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I sure hope 
nobody sees us and this humongous sack here...<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, can 
you hear that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is it a 
bunch of people crying about the fact they lost Christmas?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... it 
doesn't sound like crying.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think 
they are... singing?</p>
<p align="left">
*In the plaza, everyone is standing around a tree and singing*</p>

<img src="../../icons/Wise_One.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> On the 
twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me twelve Djinn a leaping! ...

being merry! How can they be merry? We stole Christmas from them!<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, it's 
probably hard for them to be sad about losing Christmas, seeing as they've never 
had one before.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. So 
they don't get to eat some turkey and open presents... big deal...<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Could it 
be... Christmas has a different meaning?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Huh... now 
there's a thought...<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe... 
Christmas is really about being with friends and family...<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw, who 
cares what it's about? Let's push this giant sack down Mt. Aleph and crush them 
all!<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't be 
ridiculous, Agatio. Are you forgetting they were the ones who finally saved Prox 
for us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, show a 
little gratitude, would you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If we're 
so grateful, why did we steal Christmas from them?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because 
being dead sucks. Actually, I think we've punished them enough now. Why don't we 
give the stuff back?<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-what?! 
We went to a lot of trouble to steal that stuff and now we're just giving it 
back?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um. Yes.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You suck.

singing is pretty fun.<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, it 
really is.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But it's a 
shame we've lost everything.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, look on 
the bright side. We're still getting to have a good time together.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If we just 
planned on doing stuff like this from the start, we wouldn't have had to waste 
so much time on decorating and wrapping...<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's true, 
we were very busy. And it was all for nothing.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Should we... 
I dunno, find out who was behind stealing Christmas?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It doesn't 
seem right to just let them get away with it.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, hey, 
here's your stuff.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We had a 
change of heart and decided to give it back.<br>
<img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I didn't!<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, put a 
sock in it already, Agatio...<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah! Ghosts!<br>

Menardi, Agatio and Karst?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You stole 
Christmas from us?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> TURKEY!<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sigh... you 
need to be treated for turkey obsession, I swear.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why did you 
do that?<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, 
because we're dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And we 
really hate being dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So we 
decided to get back at you guys by taking Christmas away.<br>
<img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If it helps, 
we're sorry you're dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. We 
didn't know about the whole hometown in danger situation from the start.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why don't you 
join us for Christmas? It's not fair to be left out just because you're dead.<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> As long as I 
get my turkey, I don't care.<br>
<img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Eh, you 
really mean it? We can join you?<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> As long as 
you behave yourselves, yes.<br>
<img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aww, 
you're pretty sweet for an obnoxious brat.<br>
<img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ...<br>
<img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh boy. This 
is going to be a long day.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why couldn't 
I have been struck down with a nasty cold or something today? Why?<br>
<img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, hush, 
Felix. We're going to have a nice, fun Christmas. Why would you want to miss it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes...
