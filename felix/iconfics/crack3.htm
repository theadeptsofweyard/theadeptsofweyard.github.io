Uh, guys, I've got a bit of a problem here. I was snooping around
Kraden's cottage and found some strange bubbly, pink goop. I stole it
for some reason and decided to drink it last night (it smelled so good
and it tasted good too! Don't worry, I gave some to a Djinni, to make
sure it wasn't poisoned!)<br><br>... Um, and then... this morning, I woke up as a woman! ;_;<br><br>My muscles are gone! And... I've got these... huge... BREASTS.<br><br>OMG SOMEONE HELP ME! ._. <br><br>... And for some reason, I'm wearing a sailor suit. I was NOT wearing this last night!<br><br>*runs around in a panic* I DON'T WANT TO BE A WOMAN! SOMEBODY HELP!</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... *blushes* I... er...<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? <i>What?!</i> Do you know how to cure this? TELL ME!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> N-no... I don't... I... *chews on fingernails*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Will you please spit it out already? I haven't got time for this!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I just think they're so HUGE! *dies of shame* x_x;;;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *looks in a mirror* ... Huh. What do you know, you're right...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I... I'm trying not to look at them... but!!! ;_; I can't help it!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Perhaps... you'd like to examine them? ^_^ *lifts up shirt*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *nosebleed* Um... no thanks... o_o;;;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't be shy. ^_^ Come closer and touch my boobies...<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What are you, a prostitute?! Girls don't behave like that!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well,
I'm not a girl after all, but why don't we go to bed together? ^_-
After all, I might as well get to try out my new body just once.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stay away from me, you creep! ;_; *tries to run for it*<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *whipcrack* Where do you think you're going, Fe?<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *crash* Someone help me... ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't be afraid. ^_^ I just want to try out my NEW EQUIPMENT.<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Shouldn't you be trying to turn yourself back into a man?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But this is fun. Look, panty shot! *lifts skirt*<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You are a freak. ._.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Come on! Please? ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Geez. Fine. D=<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay! ^_^ Let's go to bed now! ;)<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure, sure... this is going to be pretty 
darn confusing though.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's really simple~! I can't give it to you up the ass but you have two holes to choose from~!<br>
<img src="../../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yay. Choices. -_-; Let's go already.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^_^ <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You tested some strange pink goop on an innocent little Djinni?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, don't worry. It didn't DIE! ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And what if it <i>had?</i> Huh?!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then I would hide the body and pretend it ran away... uh, I mean... aw, crap.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Testing on animals is WRONG!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Djinn aren't animals. They are elemental spirits.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's beside the point! You risked the life of a small, innocent creature! 
<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Would you have preferred I risk my life instead?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Is the Djinni really okay?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think so. ^_^ At least, it's not complaining or anything. It's quiet as a mouse.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh, what do you mean by quiet?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It won't even talk back to me or anything. Hey, Balm? Balm? Are you asleep?<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ... Why did you test it on a reviving Djinni? Couldn't you have tried a more useless one?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The reviving Djinn ARE useless! They always miss! ... Aw, crap.<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's wrong now?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> OMG I THINK ITS DEAD!!! ;_;
<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You Djinni killer! ;_;
<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not my fault! ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh? Then whose is it?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Er, uh... Kraden's! For making the pink goop!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* So, what are you going to with the Djinni?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Bury it. Oh, and if anyone asks, it... er, died of old age. &gt;_&gt;<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Piers, you've already told everyone you tested the pink goop on a Djinni!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I didn't say WHICH Djinni, did I? ^_^<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So you're going to claim it's a coincidence?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yup. Hey, uh, while I'm a woman, let's compare our breasts!<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *SLAP* No way! Pervert!<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If I was being a pervert, I wouldn't have to look at someone else's breasts. ^_^ I have my own. ^_-<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ew. Just... ew. You make me sick.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're no fun, Mia. ;_;<br>
<img src="../../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just go turn yourself back into a man, already... -_-<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'd love to. I just don't know how yet. &gt;_&gt;;<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Have you tried asking Kraden?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So I should go up to him, confess to stealing the goop, then ask if he's got a cure for this?<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yup.<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you insane? I'm not doing that!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why not? He might have the cure to his OWN potion. &gt;_&gt;<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But
then he will get cross and lecture me for HOURS AND HOURS about how
stealing is wrong, then probably do experiments on me or something!<br>
<img src="../../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You'd rather stay a woman forever?<br>
<img src="../../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> T_T I guess I have no choice...<br>
