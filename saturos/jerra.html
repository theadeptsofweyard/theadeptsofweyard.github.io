<center>Why Garet's last name is not 'Jerra'
<br>(<b>AKA</b> The Translators' Screwup)</center>

<p><br>
<p><br></p>
<p>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Is this the part where I'm meant to pledge undying devotion to you? <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32"> 
Eh, a lifetime's supply of cookies will do. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Well, this is great news. I don't have to worry about marrying Garet... can you 
imagine? Jenna Jerra? Ugh! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
You don't need to marry him anyway... <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
STFU. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Jenna, there are young, impressionable- <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
If they are young and impressionable, they don't know what STFU means. Shut up.
<br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Who on earth has the name 'Jerra' anyway? Were the translators on crack? <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32"> 
Well, they messed my name up, didn't they? <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32"> 
And they forgot to change 'Urumuchi' (Ulmuch) to 'Hsu', like they did in GS, in 
TLA! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32"> 
Order, order, everybody! The point of this page is to explain why Garet's last 
name isn't Jerra, so lets roll! </p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<table border="1" width="100%" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td><img SRC="gerald.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
		<td>Incriminating picture #1!
<p>This is Garet's name, using the debug room in Ougon no Taiyou: Hirakareshi Fuuin... 
er, the Japanese version of Golden Sun, and did
you know, the original Japanese version had a title, like The Lost Age?
Hirakareshi Fuuin translates to The Broken Seal. Ok, now we have
Katakana characters here.
<p>Je-ra-ru-do. So what does Jerarudo translate to? Gerald. That's Garet's Japanese name of 
course.
		<p>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img SRC="gmama.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
			<td>It's Garet's mother.<p>Notice that the first two kana characters are 'Jera'. Where have we seen them before? Oh, that's right, in the kana for Gerald!
			The other characters say 'Mama', so we have Jera-mama...<p>I guess that to say Jerarudo-mama... it was either too much, so it 
wouldn't fit, or they were lazy. Pick which ever one you like best. So they 
basically shortened it to Jera-mama... and of course, Jera is part of the 
katakana for Gerald... so what do you think it translates to? Gerald's mother...
			<p>&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img SRC="gpapa.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
				<td>Incriminating picture #3.
<p>Same thing, this time around it says Jera-papa. Gerald's father, simply enough. I'm not going
to go off on another long winded explanation, you know. I've done enough
waffling! Next!
				<p>&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><img SRC="brother.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
					<td>Incriminating picture #4!
<p>Again, we have 'jera' plus 'otouto' 
which means 'little brother'. So 'Jera-otouto' basically says it's the younger 
brother of Garet.<p>&nbsp;</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img SRC="sister.png" NOSAVE height=160 width=240></td>
						<td>Incriminating picture #5!
<p>This time it says 'Jera-ane'. 'Ane' means 'older sister', so that would be 
Garet's older sister.<p>&nbsp;</td>
						</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;<p>So there you go, that's Garet and his family... no names 
for any of them or anything.&nbsp;
<p>So, that makes us question, where did the translators pull out a name like 'Jerra' from?
<p>They didn't realise that 'Jera' stood for 'Jerarudo' and translated
it directly to 'Jerra' and left it in there, in the debug room... They
changed Jera-mama and Jera-papa to Mrs Jerra and Mr Jerra, and they gave
his sister and brother names and made them Kay Jerra and Aaron Jerra... silly 
translators. They should have just translated the parents directly
as Garet's mother, Garet's father...
None of this &quot;Jerra" nonsense. But I'm ok with them giving Kay and Aaron their names.<p>
&nbsp;<p></p>

<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Yay! Caz rules! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
Wow... amazing...<br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32"> 
I'm gonna have to learn some Japanese so that I can study the Japanese GS 
closely... exposing translators sure is fun. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
You think you'll get away with it, but any second now the <strike>Empire</strike> 
Translators will come banging on your door and you'll have to send this out with 
a droid in an escape pod or something. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32"> 
No way, I don't want to be Princess Leia! Make Jenna be! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Are you kidding? She kissed her brother! I'd rather kiss a frog than Felix! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
Could have been worse, she could have- <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Shut up! I'm not being Luke either! He's whiny! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32"> 
STFU! This is not Star Wars, the Translators are not an evil empire headed by 
Felix's dad with a toaster on his head, Jenna and Felix are not twins either, 
nobody in the games are twins, and... damn, it would be funny though. The 
Princess Jenna rushes to get the Translator's deepest, darkest secrets to the 
Rebel Alliance while pursued by the Translators, and they land in the hands of 
Felix... heh heh... and Anakin was <i>way </i>whinier! <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> Are you done 
yet? <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
So NOW we know why I was supposedly the ONLY one with a last name. I don't have 
one. Nobody does. It makes perfect sense now. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/aaron.gif" width="32"> 
So am I kinda nameless... <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Well, the translators gave you a name... <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
If someone's a die-hard, loyal to the original version purist, then yeah, you're 
kinda nameless from their point of view. <br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> 
Right, and it's like calling me Picard, instead of Piers. Which I don't get...<br>
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
You guys done trying to be funny? Great, because I think the reader might like 
to go and ponder the latest revelations/plot the death of translators/have 
supper/discover what kind of crack translators smoke/insert random pasttime 
here... </p>
