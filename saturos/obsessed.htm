<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aw man. 
One of those stupid obsession lists?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, they 
are kind of stupid, aren't they?<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess 
that's the whole point.<br>
<img src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yep. When I have 
stupid ideas, they can go here.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you just 
plaguing the site with Internet fads that went out of style ten years ago?<br>
<img src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey, if it means I 
can come up with more random and funny stuff, what's wrong with that?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Does anybody 
even write these kinds of lists anymore?<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not 
even sure what my section is about anymore. Well, the title is self explanatory, 
so I won't bother explaining.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">You mistake people in real life for someone who is actually in 
the game.</p>
<p align="left">You keep dreaming at night about how Camelot has released Golden 
Sun 3/4/5/6/7...</p>
<p align="left">You go around pretending to cast Psynergy and even shout out the 
name of what it is you're 'casting'.</p>
<p align="left">You can name each and every single Djinni, its type, where it is 
found in the game and also say whether it has to be battled or not, without 
looking it up.</p>
<p align="left">You refer to your pets as Djinn.</p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You eat a ton of apples, and wonder why 
you don't feel stronger.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You see a lighthouse that isn't lit up 
and freak out about how the world will be destroyed unless the lighthouse is 
lit.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You have memorised at least half the 
game's script.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You dress up as a GS character on a 
regular basis and not just for cosplay/Halloween.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You have an insane record in the Battle 
Arena (Let's say over a hundred monsters. o_o This would be easier in the first 
game.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You paint a big eye on a giant rock and 
run away screaming "IT'S THE WISE ONE!"</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You hate writing essays about a book with 
a character whose name is spelt similarly to a GS character because you're 
afraid you'll spell it the GS character's way (Guilty of this. And I only wrote 
it as Alex once... *hides* It was Tess of the d'Urbervilles... I think I spelled 
that wrong. Oh well. Who cares?)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You deliberately save a penguin in 
distress and expect a reward from its lover.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You write over a hundred fanfics for this 
game and draw an insane amount of fanart as well.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You've tried to get Camelot's 
address/phone number/email so that you can contact them and ask them to release 
GS3.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You try to learn Japanese so that you can 
actually contact them in their own language.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You have lots of dreams about Golden Sun.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You make an online journal and post a 
zillion entries in it about the game.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="postbody">You find yourself yelling "POW POW PICARD!" 
in real life.</span></p>
<p align="left">You scream out loud if your family suggests going to visit Ayers 
Rock.</p>
<p align="left">You level your characters up to Level 99 in the first game.</p>
<p align="left">You buy a sword, because you want to be like the sword users.</p>
<p align="left">You break into people's houses and look in their 
jars/barrels/ovens/beds, hoping to find something.</p>
<p align="left">You waste your time drawing stick figure characters doing stuff 
when you're bored.</p>
<p align="left">You throw a tennis ball at your dog while yelling "Pok√© Ball, 
Go!" Oh, whoops. Wrong game. (What's wrong with doing that? &gt;_&gt; I'm not insane. 
Uh oh, are the men in white coats coming for me? I'd better run for it. *flees*)</p>
<p align="left">You waste your time making a silly page like this.</p>
