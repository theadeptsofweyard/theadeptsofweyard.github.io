		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #1</b>
<br><i>Aren't Garet and Jenna brother and sister?</i></td>
		<td>Oh, boy... seems like people are accusing
all the Flameshippers of liking incest or something... heh. I mean, you'd at 
least EXPECT people to pay attention to the game right? It is plainly obvious Felix 
is Jenna's brother. Her first line is 'Oh no! My brother!' Jeez... and if Garet
and Jenna were siblings, why would so many people put them together?
Pay attention to the game! It's obvious Garet and Jenna are not
related... I'll let people off if they haven't played the game in a long time 
and their memory sucks... but it's still silly.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #2</b>
<br><i>Aren't Isaac and Garet cousins?</i></td>
		<td>Why do people think Garet is related to everybody? People think
that Isaac and Garet might be cousins, simply because Garet's little brother,
Aaron, calls Isaac's mother 'Aunty Dora'. Aaron's a child! It's only natural he might look up to her and call her 'Aunty' even
if she isn't his aunt, it's not necessarily the sister of your mother or
father, it's sometimes used as an endearing term by children. Well, I dunno,
but I'm pretty sure Isaac and Garet are not really cousins. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #3</b>
<br><i>Piers's the Prince of Lemuria!</i></td>
		<td>*sigh* I still want to know who started this one... back when people
were still playing the Japanese version of TLA, they started assuming he
was the Prince, but he is not. His mother and father are both dead, and
he is not related to King Hydros, therefore Piers cannot be the Lemurian
Prince! There is no prince... </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #4</b>
<br><i>Garet has two sisters</i></td>
		<td>Hehe, I thought so too once, until the Debug Room proved me wrong. Garet
only has one sister- Kay, his older sister. His younger sibling is his
little brother, Aaron. He does look spookily like a girl though, but I'm
sure he's a boy because his 'voice' (the tune you hear when people speak)
is somewhat lower than other younger girls, which are always really high. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #5</b>
<br><i>Garet's last name is Jerra</i></td>
		<td>This isn't so much as a misconception as a bad translation error.
Go <a href="jerra.html">here</a> for more information.
</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #6<br>
</b><i>Felix is not a Valean!</i></td>
		<td>I am still reeling from the 
utter stupidity of this blatant lie I once found on a Wikipedia article (which I 
very quickly got rid of.) The utter moron who was clearly DROPPED ON THE HEAD AS 
A KID claimed that Felix was not related to Jenna and was Proxian by birth! ... 
All those with EYES will realise what a bloody stupid statement this is, because 
he looks like his sister and is most definitely obviously not a freaking Proxian. 
They have pale skin, pointy ears and red eyes for crying out loud! I'm sure the 
person who wrote this is off somewhere claiming that Kraden and Babi were 
brothers or Hama was lying and is actually Ivan's great-great-great grandmother 
and Sheba's secret daughter. ... Can you tell I'm furious at the idiot's 
stupidity? Because I am.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid 
Misconception #7<br>
</b><i>Felix is Isaac's long-lost brother!</i></td>
		<td>Yes. Scream in 
horror, Valeshippers. According to 
		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Golden-Sun-The-Lost-Age/dp/B00008KU9Z/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1196360754&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon UK</a>, 
		you've been writing incest fics. Shame 
on you all. Shame on Sheba too. *sigh* You see, Amazon needed a description of the 
game so they decided to play it. Yet, they apparently smoked hefty amounts of crack while 
playing TLA, and in the process, everything became warped. And that is how they 
ended up believing Isaac and Felix were brothers. *sighs and shakes head* 
Idiots. Clearly someone wasn't paying attention in Madra. Or anywhere for that 
matter.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Stupid Misconception #8<br>
		</b><i>You can get stuck in Lemuria!</i></td>
		<td>In short, no. No, you CAN'T. Some people have came up with the 
		notion that if you give Piers the Lash Pebble in Lemuria, you can get 
		stuck (since you use Lash to get into Lunpa's tower.) Obviously, none of 
		these people bothered to test the "glitch" and ran around screaming that 
		you could get stuck in Lemuria when it's all a blatant lie. Here's the 
		truth. If you already gave the Lash Pebble to Piers, Lunpa will insult 
		you and then throw down a PRETTY SHINY ROPE to climb up instead! There 
		is no glitch.</td>
