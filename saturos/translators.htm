Mwehehehehehehe...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
I don't get it. Is that supposed to scare us?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> 
Get lost, you brat!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> 
Um... translators are being exposed?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Saturos has a new page?<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
Sure! Translation errors are stupid, so they get to be in my section for 
stupid stuff!<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32"> 
I'm sure Agatio would feel at home in this section...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
Well, tough, it's MY section. ^_^<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
So... wherever translators screwed up...<br>

It all goes here! ^_^<br>

Take that, translators!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u><i>Golden Sun</i></u></p>
<p align="left">In Imil, the old lady claims Alex was Mia's apprentice. However, 
this is completely false. Alex was Mia's <b>father's</b> apprentice.</p>
<p align="left">Mia actually refers to her deceased father in the Japanese 
version of Golden Sun. Whatever did the translators have against Mia's father?</p>
<p align="left">There are some interesting things to be found in the Golden Sun 
debug room. Most interesingly, they gave Garet and his family a surname, as well 
as names for his siblings. There's a detailed explanation of this
<a href="jerra.html">here</a>, so I won't bother going into it here. </p>
<p align="left">The debug room's list of characters has some other oddities as 
well. One of the names is skipped at some 
point, so all the names after that are out of order. It's the same in the 
Japanese version. Strangely enough, while most names are accurately translated, 
Jenna is referred to as &quot;Jasmine&quot; (her Japanese name) and even her younger 
picture is called &quot;Jasmine (child)&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">Faran also gets the Japanese name treatment, being referred to 
as &quot;Gyorgis&quot;.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="gyorgis.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left"><i>Yes, I know that's Shadow 
Babi. Remember, I said the names were out of order.</i></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="wrongname.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left"><i>I have nothing against the name, but it obviously doesn't fit 
into the 5 character limit. Hence, why her name is Jenna... (then again, they 
changed Robin and Mary...)</i></p>
<p align="left">There are other small errors to be found throughout the game. 
Menardi's &quot;Death Size&quot; should be &quot;Death Scythe&quot; and the Blessing attacks were 
breath (buresu) attacks. Buresu can be read as bless, hence Blessing. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u><i>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</i></u></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Hama got a spelling change. In the first game, she's Hama. In 
the second game, she becomes Hamma. Her name in the original Japanese version 
was &quot;Hamo&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">In a similar vein to Hama, Hsu also became Ulmuch kind of. If you save Hsu 
in the first game and transfer the password, you'll meet Feizhi in Champa and 
she claims that Isaac saved &quot;Ulmuch&quot;. Hsu's Japanese name is Urumuchi. 
Turns out there's a good reason for this. Golden Sun: The Lost Age's string 
compression forbids certain combinations of letters, so they were unable to use 
the name &quot;Hsu&quot;. A better way of working round this would have been to use male 
pronouns instead of a name. </p>
<p align="left">In Apojii, if you read a lady's mind, she thinks that ships have 
not been coming to &quot;Garapas&quot; lately. Apojii is called Garapas in the 
Japanese version, so this is a case of them forgetting to use the translated 
term. </p>
<p align="left">In Trial Road, Felix breaks the muteness 
code and utters the word &quot;Why?&quot;. He is stubborn and argumentative, but he never 
actually rebelled against his 'muteness'. In the Japanese version, Felix said 
&quot;?&quot; not &quot;Why?&quot;.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="questionmark.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="why.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left"><i>So ? is actually pronounced why?, is it?</i></p>
<p align="left">Ah, yes, there's more. Notice how in Yallam, Sunshine's wife 
doesn't tell you how much a newly forged weapon will cost you? As a matter of 
fact, she did tell you the price in the Japanese version. Whoops.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="price.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left"><i>Too bad you don't get to know that it costs 9900 coins in the 
English version...</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Interestingly enough, the dragonsbane Susa is feeding to the 
Serpent was sake in the Japanese version. I understand why they did this though, 
to protect the E rating. Can you imagine what would happen? All those poor 
children seeing Susa feeding the serpent sake and getting the irresistible urge to 
raid the fridge and cupboards and consume every alcoholic beverage in sight so 
they can get drunk like the serpent!</p>
<p align="left">If they know what sake <i>is</i>... (I understand alcohol gets 
censored in media intended for younger people, but it's still silly. The same 
children will see their parents and even other people drinking wine, beer, etc. 
so what's the deal with the taboo?) </p>
