<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're back 
with another story!<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And the 
pairings continue to get weirder and weirder.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, we 
know who to blame, don't we?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder if 
Caz will ever actually run out of pairings?<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Apparently 
there are about twenty possible pairings left... out of the ones who have been 
paired.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... she 
won't be running out for a long time then.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What kind of 
crazy pairing have we got this time?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We have... 
Isaac/Menardi!</p>

<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ...<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm not 
going to lie to you. This is very uncomfortable.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, I 
would have to agree with you for once. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sorry about 
the whole... preventing you from saving your hometown thing. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, no 
worries. You may have been a meddlesome little brat, but you did the right thing 
in the end. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What gender 
was the Fusion Dragon supposed to be? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We were 
trying to kill you. We weren't exactly wondering what gender we had become. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So you don't 
know either? Guess we'll never know... <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Me 
and Saturos aren't going to transform just so that you can examine us. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now I'm 
getting bad images in my mind... <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, 
don't. Hey, why don't we go and eat ice cream? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You like ice 
cream? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes, I 
love ice cream. Especially strawberry ice cream. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay then. 
*Goes to ice cream shop with Menardi and they sit down with ice cream cones* <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> This is 
good ice cream. I like it a lot. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh huh... 
*slowly eats ice cream* <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So, any 
other questions you want to ask? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Actually, 
yeah. Do those scales itch? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What? No, 
of course not. Do you think it's strange that I have scales? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not 
very common for people to have red eyes, pointy ears and scaly skin, that's all.
<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pfft. 
People who only care about appearance are so shallow. It's what on the inside 
that counts. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I guess you 
could say that. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So I look 
a little weird to non Proxians. But on the inside, you'll find that I'm just a 
sweet and caring- <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *chokes* I'm 
sorry, what?!<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
saying I'm not sweet? *looks demonic*<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> O_O; *gulps* 
No, of course you are. In fact, I'm getting diabetes just looking at you! <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why, thank 
you. *flips hair* It kinda sucks being treated like a freak just because of the 
way you look. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think the 
werewolves in Garoh probably had it worse than you. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Werewolves? Really? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. They 
would even get burned at the stake in the past. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> 
Interesting. Ok, it's my turn to ask questions. What's the deal with that scarf?
<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like it, 
that's all. It's awesome and stuff, and it makes me look cool.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If you say 
so... it looks a bit long though. Aren't you afraid you'll trip on it? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It really 
isn't that easy to trip on. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh huh, 
sure. I got another question. Why do your assist trophy in Super Smash Bros 
Brawl have such a high pitched voice?<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Too 
embarrassing to talk about? I guess I can understand. A 17 year old who hasn't 
hit puberty is...<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have hit 
puberty! T_T<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There, 
there. Being a freak of nature is nothing to be ashamed of.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If you 
weren't an insanely psychotic Mars Adept, I swear I'd be calling you a lot of 
rude things right now. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But you 
aren't stupid enough to, are you? *smiles sweetly* <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ...&nbsp; 
Anyway, I think everyone would get mad at us for fighting in the ice cream 
parlour.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pfft. I 
would set them on fire anyway.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... I'd 
rather you didn't show any homicidal tendencies.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Homicidal? 
Me? Were we really that bad? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh well. 
We might appear maniacal on the outside, but we're loveable people really. <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... right. 
Well, it's been unusual hanging out with you. Have a nice day... <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Sure, you 
too! <br>
