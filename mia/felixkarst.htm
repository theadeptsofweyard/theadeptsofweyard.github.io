<br>
For a frightening moment, Felix had thought he was seeing dead people, and he 
had a very good reason to be thinking that. It all started this morning when he 
got some threatening letter that struck fear deep into his heart. The letter had 
gone along the lines of:<br>
<br>
"Pack some overnight things and come to Prox. If you don't come, then I will 
come to you and rip out all your innards, granting you a slow and painful death.<br>
<br>
From, Anonymous."<br>
<br>
The letter had confused as well as scared Felix, but the message was clear. If 
he did not go to Prox for whatever reason, someone would kill him slowly and 
painfully, but why was he supposed to pack some overnight things? Nevertheless, 
Felix did so and hesitantly teleported over with the Teleport Lapis.<br>
<br>
As he walked into the snow covered village, he had to wonder just who had 
written that letter. The only Proxians he could think of who were insane enough 
to write threatening, violent letters like that were all dead for that matter.<br>
<br>
Felix then caught sight of a familiar pink-skinned woman with dark red hair 
standing in the middle of the village and stifled a scream. What, was that 
supposed to be Karst? Last he'd seen her, she'd been dying in the Mars 
Lighthouse. Karst and Agatio had pulled an impressive vanishing act after that 
which was probably meant to indicate their demise (never mind the fact corpses 
didn't just disappear into thin air)<br>
<br>
Karst caught sight of Felix and began walking toward him, a slightly psychotic 
grin on her face. For a terrifying moment, Felix thought he was about to die... 
and wait, how was she even alive? She had sent the note, hadn't she?<br>
<br>
"Hello, Felix," Karst said, stopping right in front of him. "I see you got the 
note after all. I'm glad to see you decided to come after all rather than risk 
facing my wrath."<br>
<br>
Karst's wrath was scary. Not just scary, it was terrifying, because she would 
literally try to KILL everyone in her way. <br>
<br>
"Uh..." Felix swallowed. "Weren't you supposed to be dead?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, a wizard did it." Karst shrugged nonchalantly. "Aren't wizards nice 
people?"<br>
<br>
"I see. So, uh, why did you call me up here and with overnight stuff?" Felix 
asked, glancing down at the small bag he had brought along.<br>
<br>
Karst's eyes narrowed and she let out an annoyed huff. "Geez, you sure are slow! 
I called you up here on a date, you idiot! Haven't you ever been on a date 
before?" She crossed her arms and looked away, appearing slightly peevish.<br>
<br>
"Well, uh, dates don't usually begin with threatening letters..." Felix 
explained, trying to appease her.<br>
<br>
"What did you think bringing the stuff was for? So I'd have a bag to put your 
dead body in?" Karst asked, causing him to flinch. "Oh, relax, I'm not going to 
harm you. I've kind of got bored of that whole grudge stuff, especially after 
that wizard told me to get the heck over it already."<br>
<br>
Felix was feeling extremely confused now. "Where do I put my stuff then?"<br>
<br>
"We're staying at the inn together, so just put it there," Karst replied. "My 
house got moved into when I was dead. How rude. And the people who moved in are 
refusing to leave, so I'm homeless! Can you believe it?"<br>
<br>
Felix decided it would be better not to say anything. The two began walking to 
the inn and Karst booked a room for them to stay in, then had Felix put his bag 
there. "It's not much of a date, I guess," she said sheepishly, "but we can 
still find something to do." Felix just hoped that something didn't involve him 
being tortured.<br>
<br>
In Prox, most things to do involved snow, considering that was all there was. So 
they ended up having a contest to see who could build the biggest snowman within 
a time limit. Felix decided he would just let Karst win, and she ended up with a 
much bigger one.<br>
<br>
"Yay, I won!" Karst danced around her snowman, cackling gleefully. "You lose, 
Felix."<br>
<br>
"I'll definitely beat you next time," Felix lied. "Just you wait." He knew Karst 
hated losing with a passion. Nobody ever tried to beat Karst unless they wanted 
to get hurt or worse.<br>
<br>
"Let's have a snowball fight now!" Karst began scooping up snow, with a smirk on 
her face. "You won't be able to dodge these."<br>
<br>
Felix had become very good at dodging snowballs. Well, what else was there to do 
when you were being held hostage in a village where it did nothing but snow for 
three years? He quickly scooped up snow, narrowly dodging Karst's snowball, then 
flung his right at her. It escalated into a full blown snowball war that lasted 
for quite a while.<br>
<br>
Eventually, he'd had enough. "I'm starting to get cold, Karst. Can't we go back 
inside now?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, you're cold?" Karst looked surprised. "I'd forgotten how quickly 
warm-blooded people could get cold. Let's hurry back inside then." Naturally, 
she didn't even feel cold at all.<br>
<br>
Felix was quite relieved to get back inside and sit in front of a fire to warm 
up. Karst sat down next to him with a couple mugs of hot chocolate and 
marshmallows.<br>
<br>
"Here you go," Karst said, handing over one of the mugs. "It will warm you up."<br>
<br>
"Thanks," Felix mumbled, breathing in the warm aroma and taking a sip. It 
certainly did warm him up. He felt much better already.<br>
<br>
Maybe this date wasn't so bad after all...</p>
