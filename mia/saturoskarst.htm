<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Already, huh?<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Seems like 
the super speedy updates are a way to make up for procrastinating for so long.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's not 
like the stories require a lot of time and effort right now...<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, since 
they are so short... and weird...<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Caz's having 
too much fun with some drabble-matic thing.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Which is 
why the stories are no longer normal... but everyone's bored of normal stories, 
right?<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm pretty 
sure Caz is bored of them...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The winning 
pairing is Saturos/Karst! And the story is bizarre...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It had been many years that Saturos and Karst had been together, 
somehow. Let's say this was an AU and they were a happily married couple. That 
works.<br>
<br>
Saturos stepped out into the warm sunshine, and, spotting Karst sitting on a 
rock, he admired Karst's shining red hair as it glistened in the sunlight. "Ah," 
he sighed, "That's a charming sight."<br>
<br>
Karst climbed off the rock and walked happily across the grass to greet her 
lover. Saturos patted Karst on the head and then tried to give her a surprise 
from behind, but without success.<br>
<br>
"That's all right," Karst said. "We can try again later."<br>
<br>
"I'm just not as good at it anymore," Saturos said in disappointment. "Not as 
amazing as the time we simply did it on a bed like normal people."<br>
<br>
Karst nodded eagerly. "We were certainly good at it back in those days."<br>
<br>
"Our bodies were younger, and we had a lot more fun with them," Saturos said. 
"Everything seems easy and fun when you're young."<br>
<br>
"Of course," Karst said. "But even now after we've been together for so many 
years, we can still have fun. If we go about it in a special way."<br>
<br>
"In a special way?" Saturos asked. "But how?"<br>
<br>
"With this," Karst said and held out a bottle of pills. "Just take that with 
some water and in half an hour, you'll be ready to do it."<br>
<br>
Saturos swallowed the pills at once and sure enough, in half an hour, they were 
able to do it like rabbits on prozac at an amusement park. Three times. Except 
they weren't at an amusement park.<br>
<br>
And then the neighbour told them to get off his lawn.</p>
