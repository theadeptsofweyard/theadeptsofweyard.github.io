Wow, an update already?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Believe it 
or not, we already got our next couple.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A fast 
turnout in the poll helped. Good job, voters!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... what's 
the winning pairing?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's... *opens 
an envelope* Garet and Jenna! You're finally getting your pairing, Flameshippers!<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Jenna skipped happily up the path to the 
cottage, her backpack bouncing as she ran. She was quite excited about having a 
vacation, however short. Jenna stopped in front of the door and turned to see 
Garet lumbering towards her, his shoulders hunched over as he stared at the 
ground while dragging his bag. Jenna raised an eyebrow and waited for him to 
reach her before she could ask her question.</p>
<p align="left">"Why are you looking so down, Garet?" 
Jenna asked.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm not," Garet mumbled.</p>
<p align="left">"Then what?" Jenna pressed.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm... scared," Garet whispered, looking 
around nervously. "Do you feel like you're being watched?"</p>
<p align="left">"Is this about the super long warning 
Felix gave you?" Jenna raised an eyebrow. "You're just being silly, Garet."</p>
<p align="left">"But... but... he could be..." Garet 
started, but Jenna just rolled her eyes and turned around, sticking the key into 
the front door and pushing it open.</p>
<p align="left">"Don't be such a wuss." Jenna looked over 
her shoulder at him. "I like tough, macho guys."</p>
<p align="left">"You... do?" Garet's eyes widened and he 
immediately swore to be tougher. At least, he thought he was tough enough, but 
one of Felix's glares made him wobbly in the legs. He didn't admit that to 
people though.</p>
<p align="left">Jenna and Garet walked into the cottage 
and looked around. It was a fairly normal cottage and even the name wasn't 
particularly out of the ordinary.</p>
<p align="left">"I still wish we could have gone for that 
nice little house on a caldera," Garet sighed wistfully.</p>
<p align="left">"I told you once, I'm telling you again, 
volcanoes are dangerous!" Jenna snapped. "There's no way I'm staying at the top 
of one!"</p>
<p align="left">One unique thing the cottage had going for 
itself was an observatory deck on the roof, plus deck chairs. Jenna wasted no 
time in making herself a pina colada and changing into a swimsuit so that she 
could lie on a deck chair and catch some sunrays. Garet spent a few moments 
staring at her before she yelled at him to go and do something else.</p>
<p align="left">So Garet settled for looking through the 
telescope. At least he had his back to Jenna, so she wouldn't complain. Garet 
swung the telescope around checking out the scenery and spotted something in a 
nearby tree. He frowned and looked closer, his eyes widening as he realised what 
it was.</p>
<p align="left">"J-Jenna!" Garet blurted out. "Look!"</p>
<p align="left">"What?" Jenna sat up and lowered the 
sunglasses, looking at him suspiciously. "I'm not getting up to look at a bird."</p>
<p align="left">"It's Felix!" Garet cried. "Sitting in a 
tree with binoculars!"</p>
<p align="left">"Whatever, Garet," Jenna sighed, lying 
back on the deckchair and sipping from her pina colada.</p>
<p align="left">"But he's watching us..." Garet muttered, 
turning away from the telescope. "Don't you believe me?"</p>
<p align="left">"Relax, Garet, it's not like we're doing 
anything wrong," Jenna said.</p>
<p align="left">Garet frowned and briefly made a rude 
gesture in the direction of the tree before heading downstairs. It soon got 
cold, so Jenna also went downstairs and changed, before snuggling up on the 
couch with Garet.</p>
<p align="left">"Geez, I'm bored," Jenna muttered. "Let's 
play a game."</p>
<p align="left">"Okay," Garet said, looking excited. "I 
like games."</p>
<p align="left">"Truth or dare, Garet?" Jenna asked, 
smiling sweetly.</p>
<p align="left">"Um... dare." Garet saw Jenna's expression 
light up with joy and immediately wondered if he'd made the wrong choice.</p>
<p align="left">"I dare you to..." Jenna got up and walked 
to the window, turning around to face Garet with a devious smirk. "Take my shirt 
off!"</p>
<p align="left">"Eh?" Garet blurted out in shock, his eyes 
widening. Had Jenna really said that correctly? "Are you serious?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yes," Jenna said. "But if you try to 
remove my bra, I will kill you. Got that?"</p>
<p align="left">"Uh... yeah..." Garet slowly approached 
Jenna, feeling trepidation. There had to be some kind of catch here. 
Nonetheless, he removed her shirt. Jenna immediately flung her arms around his 
neck and kissed him.</p>
<p align="left">"Put your hands on my back like you're 
going to remove my bra," Jenna whispered. "But don't remove it, remember?"</p>
<p align="left">"Ok," Garet whispered hoarsely, feeling 
quite fearful as he followed her orders.</p>
<p align="left">"Now push me over there," Jenna muttered, 
ensuring that they were out of sight of the window. "You can let go now."</p>
<p align="left">"What the heck was that about?" Garet 
asked as Jenna crawled over to retrieve her shirt and slipped it back on without 
getting up.</p>
<p align="left">"You still don't get it?" Jenna burst out 
laughing.</p>
<p align="left">Garet stared at her then looked up at the 
window. Realisation dawned on him. "Holy cow! You made me do that in front of 
the <i>window</i>!"</p>
<p align="left">"Now you get it." Jenna grinned and went 
back to sit on the sofa. "Now will you truth or dare me?"</p>
<p align="left">"But... but..." Garet spluttered 
incredulously, staggering over to the sofa. "Felix will KILL me!"</p>
<p align="left">"No, he won't," Jenna said wearily. "Truth 
or dare me."</p>
<p align="left">"Truth or dare?" Garet felt horribly 
scared. Any second now, Felix might be beating down the door and coming to 
murder him...</p>
<p align="left">"Truth!" Jenna chirped.</p>
<p align="left">"Are you evil?" Garet squinted 
suspiciously at her.</p>
<p align="left">Jenna frowned. "Really, Garet, what kind 
of question is that?"</p>
<p align="left">"You're practically goading Felix into 
beating me up!" Garet exclaimed. "That was mean!"</p>
<p align="left">"I suppose it was," Jenna said slowly. "Oh 
well... hey, it's almost dinnertime! Time to cook!"</p>
<p align="left">Garet stared as she ran out of the room, 
his mouth wide open. She was trying to use food to distract him. Did everyone 
think he liked food that much? Probably. He pouted and pulled his legs up to his 
chest, looking sulky.</p>
<p align="left">Curry for dinner was enough to appease him 
somewhat, especially since Jenna had made it extra spicy. Felix hadn't even come 
over so Garet figured either he hadn't seen or was plotting to get Garet when 
they got back home. Garet desperately prayed it was the former.</p>
<p align="left">They spent the evening cuddling together 
and playing random games until bedtime, and headed upstairs at the same time.</p>
<p align="left">"Sure you don't want to share a room?" 
Jenna smirked.</p>
<p align="left">"No way," Garet said, backing away from 
her. Normally, he wouldn't mind, but the fact that Felix might still be watching 
them (Garet really was too paranoid) was enough to keep him from doing it. "I'm 
sleeping by myself."</p>
<p align="left">"Oh well." Jenna shrugged. "I probably 
wasn't going to let you share anyway. Goodnight, Garet." She kissed him on the 
cheek.</p>
<p align="left">"Night, Jenna," Garet said, kissing her 
back.</p>
