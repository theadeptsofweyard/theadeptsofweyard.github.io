Huh, we sure took a while to get around to this...<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was far, 
far too long!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Caz must be 
punished for her procrastination!<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She did just 
have a month's vacation...<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
suppose that could be why...<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, enough 
of this, what's the winning pairing?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *opens 
envelope* ... I guess Imilshippers are in for a treat, because the winning 
pairing is Alex/Mia...</p>

<p align="left">Mia trudged along the path, a backpack on 
her back, pulling along a second bag. She was entirely alone as she approached 
the cottage. Mia read the sign and it proclaimed the place to be "Blind Date 
Cottage". Evidently intended for those kind of surprises. Mia wrinkled her nose 
and pulled a key out of her pocket. This was why she was here. Suddenly, she had 
been notified by Jenna and Sheba she was to pack her stuff and come here, and 
she would have a special date.</p>
<p align="left">The problem was, they hadn't told her WHO 
her date was. It had all been planned in secret apparently. As Mia walked 
through the door and closed it behind her, she looked around the cottage while 
wondering yet again who her blind date was. Why couldn't they have told her?</p>
<p align="left">The first thing Mia noticed was that the 
cottage was intensely dark. There were not many windows and only a couple of 
candlesticks could be found, the matches turning up in a drawer. Mia was not 
very impressed as she dragged the bags to her bedroom, bumping into things on 
the way. The name of the cottage had been somewhat more literal than she 
thought. She sat sulkily on her bed, swearing to sue the travel agency, as she 
rubbed a bruise on her knee.</p>
<p align="left">Alex stood on the path, staring at "Blind 
Date Cottage" and wondered for what was not the first time why he was even 
bothering with this. Somehow, he had been persuaded to come here by a 
particularly violent Jenna and an almost as violent Sheba. Not wanting to be hit 
by Spark Plasma and Dragon Fume, Alex had eventually just packed his stuff and 
headed off. He shifted a bag from one shoulder to the other and contemplated who 
his blind date might be. It might not be Jenna or Sheba, considering they had 
told him it was a blind date, so the clues pointed to Mia.</p>
<p align="left">A bead of sweat trickled down his face as 
he approached the front door. Sure, he'd spent his life in the same town as Mia, 
but then there had been that small matter of abandoning Imil and betraying the 
Mercury Clan. After everything he'd done, Mia terrified him and he wasn't sure 
Mia even liked him. Alex sincerely prayed that there were no frying pans in the 
house and Mia hadn't brought her mace along as he tried the door. It was 
unlocked, so he let himself in and recoiled as he took a tour of the cottage. It 
was DARK in here.</p>
<p align="left">As Alex walked up the stairs, he heard 
movement. Mia was already here, wasn't she? He cried out as he bumped into 
something sitting on the stairs (why was there something on the stairs?) and 
eventually reached the top, only to hear a loud scream. A figure standing on top 
of the stairs, swinging down a vase toward his head, was the last thing he saw 
before he rolled down the stairs and fell unconscious.</p>
<p align="left">Alex groggily awoke sometime later on the 
floor and blearily looked up to see a shell-shocked Mia standing above him. Once 
she saw he was awake, she exploded.</p>
<p align="left">"What did you think you were doing 
wandering around the cottage in the dark?" Mia yelled. "I thought it might have 
been a burglar or something! And for that matter, just what are you doing here, 
Alex?"</p>
<p align="left">"What did you think you were doing, 
beating people over the head with vases?" Alex snapped. "And I'm only here 
because Jenna and Sheba threatened to hurt me if I didn't come!"</p>
<p align="left">"Jenna and Sheba... wait a minute..." Even 
in the dark, Mia looked visibly pale. "You're not here for... a date?"</p>
<p align="left">"Apparently I am," Alex said nervously. He 
sent a silent prayer to the heavens that she wasn't going to snap and beat him 
over the head with a heavy object.</p>
<p align="left">"No way!" Mia laughed incredulously. "This 
can't be happening!" She screamed and ran, although she didn't get far before a 
loud thud followed. Alex stared at the heap on the floor.</p>
<p align="left">"Mia?" Alex called out. He shook his head 
in amazement. "She crashed into the <i>wall</i>..."</p>
<p align="left">Mia awoke lying on the couch. She groaned 
and reached up to rub her bruised forehead, cursing the wall for getting in her 
way. Wait, how had she ended up here? Mia sat up and shook her head, looking 
around the very, very dim room. It was then that she spotted a mysterious figure 
sitting on a chair nearby. Mia screamed again in terror. It had to be some 
intruder and they were going to slit her throat... she reached out, fumbling for 
something she could use...</p>
<p align="left">"Mia, calm down!" Alex exclaimed, rushing 
over to her. "Sheesh, what's wrong with you?"</p>
<p align="left">"It's dark!" Mia cried out, putting a hand 
over her chest. Her heart was beating rapidly. "Every time I see you, I think 
you're some robber or..."</p>
<p align="left">"Mia, we are the only ones here," Alex 
said patiently. "Okay, how about I lock the door and we won't have to worry 
about people coming in?"</p>
<p align="left">"I hate this," Mia sighed. "Why do I have 
to be stuck in this house with YOU?"</p>
<p align="left">"Is that a bad thing?" Alex sounded 
offended.</p>
<p align="left">"You're evil!" Mia exclaimed, pointing 
accusingly at Alex. "And... and... you betrayed our clan!"</p>
<p align="left">"You have no proof I'm evil," Alex told 
her. "Which I am not, by the way. And if the Mercury Lighthouse hadn't been lit, 
Weyard would just have been destroyed."</p>
<p align="left">"True, I guess..." Mia pouted. "You're 
still an annoying jerk though."</p>
<p align="left">Alex closed his eyes and counted to ten, 
holding onto his patience. Evidently, Mia wasn't going to drop her grudge 
against him anytime soon. He quietly went over to sit on his chair.</p>
<p align="left">Minutes passed.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm bored," Mia said.</p>
<p align="left">More minutes passed.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm bored as well," Alex said.</p>
<p align="left">An hour or so passed.</p>
<p align="left">"Want to play a game?" Mia asked.</p>
<p align="left">"I suppose," Alex said eventually.</p>
<p align="left">They started with I Spy, then somehow 
managed to play Rock Paper Scissors, and continued playing assorted games. Mia 
managed to forget she hated Alex's guts and then they got to talking about 
various things. The time flew past and now it was time for dinner. Dinner was a 
rather startling experience considering they couldn't see a thing and one of the 
worse incidents was when the salt was mixed up with the pepper. Fortunately, 
Alex and Mia survived the meal and went back to talking some more. Somehow they 
ended up sitting next to each other on the couch and indulged in bodily contact, 
which Mia didn't reject.</p>
<p align="left">Alex let out a yawn. It was getting late 
already? "We had fun, didn't we?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah, I suppose we did." Mia smiled, her 
head resting on his shoulder. "It would have been better if the whole place 
wasn't so dark."</p>
<p align="left">Eventually, they went to their respective 
beds and settled down for the night, looking forward to the morning.</p>
