Here you go!</p>

<br>
Agatio sipped slowly at his drink and stood still behind a tree. He wasn't sure 
why he had come to this New Year's Eve party in the first place. He was no good 
at parties anyhow. They always made him feel awkward and he ended up like he was 
now, hiding and hoping nobody noticed how red his face got when he was nervous. 
Yes, even scaled people could go red in the face. They weren't as cold blooded 
as people thought.<br>
<br>
Well, truth be told, Agatio knew very well why he was at the party: to see 
Menardi.<br>
<br>
Ah, Menardi. Just the thought of her, the chance of a glimpse of her curved 
figure beneath her figure hugging dress made Agatio's heart beat like the 
thunderous beat of sticks upon a drum.<br>
<br>
But tonight everyone was masked. Agatio peered intently through the crowd, 
trying to guess which guest was Menardi. There, he thought, the woman over by 
the fountain, the slender one with the Mars Djinni mask. It had to be Menardi. 
No one else could look so hot, even in a Mars Djinni mask.<br>
<br>
She began to walk Agatio's way and Agatio started to panic. What if she actually 
talked to Agatio?<br>
<br>
Menardi came right up to Agatio and Agatio thought that he was going to faint.<br>
<br>
"Hello," Menardi said in a warm voice. "What are you doing over here all alone?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, just looking for you," Agatio said and immediately wanted to die because 
that sounded so needy.<br>
<br>
Just then, a charming voice began to count down. "Ten ... nine ... eight ... 
seven ..."<br>
<br>
Agatio's heart leapt. If they were together at midnight, that meant that Menardi 
might ...<br>
<br>
"Happy New Year!"<br>
<br>
Menardi swept Agatio into her arms, pushed him into the tree, and kissed Agatio 
lovingly, slipping him the tongue and groping his chest.<br>
<br>
Agatio could hardly believe it. How wonderful! And now that it was after 
midnight, it was time to take their masks off. He reached out sadly and pulled 
Menardi's mask off her face. It was Menardi! "I knew it was you," Agatio said 
and took his own mask off.<br>
<br>
"And it's ... you," Menardi said. "You know, I'm just going to go get some 
punch."<br>
<br>
Agatio watched her go. She would be right back, Agatio was sure. Just as soon as 
she had her punch.<br>
<br>
And then they would fall in love.</p>
