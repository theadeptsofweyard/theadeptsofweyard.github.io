Hmm. Interesting.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What is it, 
Mia?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's time to 
announce the winning couple, right?<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The poll 
doesn't have many votes, but you have a couple, don't you?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well... I kind 
of have a tie.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow, Mia, 
I've never seen you wear a tie before!<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Garet, you 
idiot. -_-<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I only voted 
once. I think you can guess what for. ^_^<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, thanks, 
you added another couple to the tie. Three couples have 2 votes each.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Only 2? 
That's a shame.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Caz's fault 
for leaving this thing for so long. Anyway, the winning couples are Garet/Mia, 
Alex/Jenna and Felix/Sheba.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ;_; I have 
to be near that oaf?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hey! Be 
nicer to Garet, Felix!<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How did you 
know I meant Garet?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... er... 
touch√©?</p>

<p align="left">The tall and elegant mansion rose above the horizon upon the 
large hill. A flight of steps had been carved neatly into the hill, providing a 
somewhat easy passage to the mansion. Six people stood at the bottom of this 
hill.</p>
<p align="left">"A flight of steps up a hilll, huh?" Mia raised an eyebrow. "I 
don't think they mentioned this in the brochure. But then again, I was a little 
suspicious of Smell a Rat Travel Agency. What kind of a name is that? What are 
you supposed to do there, smell a rat?"</p>
<p align="left">"I shall escort you," Alex held out his hand to Jenna. "May I?"</p>
<p align="left">"Why, certainly," Jenna smiled and placed her hand in Alex's.</p>
<p align="left">"That's not fair," Felix muttered as Alex warped out with Jenna. 
"What about us who have to walk?" He suddenly noticed a small sandbank embedded 
into a part of the hill. "Hey, how convenient!" The happy Venus Adept ran to the 
sandbank, cast Sand and slithered up the hill.</p>
<p align="left">"I... really... don't want to walk," Garet whimpered, as Mia and 
Sheba began ascending the hill.</p>
<p align="left">"Fine, we'll see you when our vacation's over!" Sheba yelled 
down at him.</p>
<p align="left">"Don't be so lazy, Garet," Mia chided, frowning at the upset 
Mars Adept.</p>
<p align="left">"Eek," Garet's spirits sank. Instead of taking pity, his girl 
had simply frowned at him. His heart was near broken by this tragic occurrence. 
"Oh, please have pity upon me, Mia! Forgive me!" He fell to his knees 
melodramatically.</p>
<p align="left">There was no answer. Garet looked up and sweated when he saw the 
girls already halfway up the hill and ignoring him. "Aw, crap."</p>
<p align="left">"Wow! The mansion's beautiful!" Jenna squealed as she walked 
inside with Alex.</p>
<p align="left">"It definitely seems worth the uphill walk," Alex said 
approvingly.</p>
<p align="left">Felix walked in behind them and blinked at the decor. "It's... 
sparkly."</p>
<p align="left">"I like sparkly!" Jenna squealed.</p>
<p align="left">"I think some people think otherwise," Alex took her by the arm. 
"Come on, let's go find a room for ourselves."</p>
<p align="left">"My eyes," Felix whimpered and rubbed his eyes. "I can't stand 
all this sparkly."</p>
<p align="left">"Wow!" Sheba walked in behind him. "This place looks pretty 
good. Except a bit odd."</p>
<p align="left">"It's blinding me," Felix complained.</p>
<p align="left">"Cheer up, Felix," Sheba grinned. "We're here to have fun! And I 
get to spend it with you!"</p>
<p align="left">"It's going to be fun before Garet's farting ruins it all or 
something," Felix really wished Garet hadn't come along. "Anyway, let's go pick 
some rooms."</p>
<p align="left">"I want a really big room with a four poster bed with silk 
drapes and large, soft plush cushions," Sheba said dreamily as she followed 
Felix. "And I get this four poster bed all to myself. Fit for... a queen!"</p>
<p align="left">"Wow," Mia hung back, watching them leave the hallway. "Talk 
about delusions of grandeur." She turned and looked out the door, waiting for 
Garet.</p>
<p align="left">After about five minutes, Mia gave up and went to get a room.</p>
<p align="left">About an hour later, Garet arrived at the mansion's entrance, 
sweaty and red faced, gasping for breath. He dumped his bags on the floor and 
followed the sound of conversation.</p>
<p align="left">Garet found everyone in a cosy living room, playing Twister.</p>
<p align="left">Felix mechanically span the dial of the wheel and then said in a 
monotone. "Mia. Right hand. Red 3."</p>
<p align="left">"Ugh..." Mia struggled to do so, grimacing as she found her hand 
very close to Alex's face. Why did she have to be here with him? She hated him!</p>
<p align="left">"Hey, you're not looking up my skirt, are you?" Jenna 
uncomfortably looked down, bumping Sheba who yelped.</p>
<p align="left">"I would never do such a thing!" Mia exclaimed.</p>
<p align="left">"Sheba, Left Foot, Blue 4," Felix spoke out.</p>
<p align="left">"I... can't..." Sheba struggled, widening her legs as she 
attempted to place her foot down. She looked down and went red. "Hey, you can 
see up my dress!"</p>
<p align="left">"I'm not!" Felix exclaimed, his eyes fixed firmly on the wheel.</p>
<p align="left">"I can't believe you!" Sheba cried out, accidentally bumping 
Jenna back.</p>
<p align="left">"Wah!" Jenna flailed and slipped.</p>
<p align="left">"Ow! My eye!" Alex lurched forwards, upsetting Mia, who yelled 
and reversed back into Sheba.</p>
<p align="left">The balance was predictably thrown off...</p>
<p align="left">"AAH!"</p>
<p align="left">Felix winced as they all fell in a heap and a cloud of dust 
wafted upwards. Garet started laughing.</p>
<p align="left">"Ow ow ow!" yelled Jenna, who was at the bottom of the heap. 
"Get off me!"</p>
<p align="left">Eventually, the heap sorted itself out and everyone sat fuming 
around the Twister mat, trying to decide whose fault it was the game ended in 
such a way.</p>
<p align="left">"Oh man, I wish I'd been playing," Garet sighed.</p>
<p align="left">"You only want to play because you're a filthy pervert!" Felix 
accused.</p>
<p align="left">"I don't want you anywhere near my girl," Alex shot daggers with 
his eyes at Garet as he hugged Jenna close to him.</p>
<p align="left">"Mmm... Alex... your cologne smells nice," Jenna buried her face 
in his chest, a dreamy smile on her face.</p>
<p align="left">"Why, thank you," Alex beamed.</p>
<p align="left">"So... you're happy to wriggle around with and eyeball other 
girls?" Mia stood up, looking upset. "I thought you cared about me."</p>
<p align="left">"I... I do!" Garet protested.</p>
<p align="left">"You're a jerk!" Mia ran out of the room.</p>
<p align="left">"Mia!" Garet ran after her. "I'm sorry!"</p>
<p align="left">"Are those two even a couple?" Sheba rolled her eyes.</p>
<p align="left">"An unstable one so far, it seems," Felix shook his head. "They 
are doomed."</p>
<p align="left">"Well, maybe it will work out for them," Sheba wrapped her arms 
around his chest and smiled, thinking of her future... with Felix of course.</p>
<p align="left">Eventually, Mia forgave Garet somewhat, she went from avoiding 
him to giving him sullen stares and eventually Garet felt relaxed enough to stop 
apologising profusely. Mia was scary when she was angry. Not to mention 
unpredictable.</p>
<p align="left">It was then time for supper. Jenna wanted to make the supper, 
but nobody felt like eating spicy food and Mia pointed out spicy food just made 
Garet "float the air biscuits" so to speak (more often, she stated), Alex was 
the chef.</p>
<p align="left">"Wow," Jenna chomped down on the spaghetti bolognaise. "This 
tastes great!"</p>
<p align="left">"Thank you," Alex picked up spaghetti with a fork and fed it to 
Jenna.</p>
<p align="left">"Can you guys please keep your romancing away from the table?" 
Felix complained, feeling sick to the stomach.</p>
<p align="left">"Oh, don't fuss, Felix!" Sheba picked up a meatball and offered 
it to his mouth. Felix reluctantly took it, looking embarrassed afterwards. 
Sheba giggled.</p>
<p align="left">Garet tried to follow suit, but Mia just grabbed the food and 
threw it in his face.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm not taking food from you," Mia said sulkily, returning to 
eating. "You didn't even wash your hands."</p>
<p align="left">"I'm wearing gloves, Mia," Garet pointed out.</p>
<p align="left">"... Oh," Mia blinked. "Right. But Garet, why are you wearing 
gloves at the table? Nobody else is."</p>
<p align="left">"I... I don't know!" Garet went very red and stared at his food, 
feeling ashamed. Mia shook her head, grinning.</p>
<p align="left">After supper, the couples went their separate ways. Alex and 
Jenna retreated to a cosy part of the house and proceeded to do all kind of 
slushy things that would make people hurl if they read about them.</p>
<p align="left">As for Garet and Mia, they went exploring around the mansion. 
There was a little drama involving a skeleton in a closet, but Mia convinced 
Garet that the skeleton was not going to come to life and kill them in their 
sleep so it was better just left alone.</p>
<p align="left">Felix and Sheba sat together reading a romantic novel they had 
found tucked away in a bookshelf. Felix didn't find it too pleasant at first, he 
hated romantic novels, but with Sheba next to him, it wasn't quite so bad.</p>
<p align="left">Then it was bedtime, and everyone retreated to bed. Garet was 
sad he couldn't share a room with Mia, but she stated in plain terms that she 
wasn't yet ready to sleep in the same bed as him. Whether this was due to his 
personal hygiene and loud snoring or not, she did not say.</p>
<p align="left">Sadly for hopefuls, Alex and Jenna were the only couple to sleep 
in the same bed. (Sleep? That all they did? Who knows.)</p>
