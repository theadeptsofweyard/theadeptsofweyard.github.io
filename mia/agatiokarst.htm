<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hurray! New 
story time!<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those 
Proxians really get neglected, don't they?<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But it's 
okay because we have another Proxian story!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. It's 
Agatio and Karst's turn. Rejoice!</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"That sure was a kind wizard," Karst said, sighing as she walked 
next to Agatio. They were currently walking through some random city they did 
not recognise. Why had they even been put here? "It was nice of him to bring us 
back from the dead, wasn't it?"<br>
<br>
"We have a second chance at life," Agatio said gleefully, his red eyes shining 
with joy. "Let's enjoy this second chance while we still can."<br>
<br>
"Good idea," Karst agreed, looking around the city in excitement. "I'm sure we 
were put here for a reason, though the wizard didn't say if that was true or 
not. And he even gave us this money to spend." She held up a large bag that 
jangled noisily with the sound of shaking coins.<br>
<br>
"Then let's..." Agatio paused, gazing thoughtfully at a small shop. He then 
grinned and pointed. "Let's go and eat ice-cream first! I haven't had ice cream 
in forever!"<br>
<br>
"Well, it's not so popular in Prox for some reason," Karst said, lightly 
shrugging her shoulders. "Sure, I don't see why not."<br>
<br>
Agatio and Karst then walked into the little ice cream shop. The few people 
eating ice cream inside saw them and promptly ran out of the shop screaming. The 
ice cream vendor fell to the floor behind the counter, shaking in fear.<br>
<br>
"Hey!" Karst shouted over the counter, glaring down at the shivering man. "You 
going to give us some ice cream or not?"<br>
<br>
"Y... yes..." the man squeaked, peeping over the counter. "Wh-what flavours 
would you like to have?"<br>
<br>
"I want mint chocolate chip!" Agatio declared, after looking at the menu.<br>
<br>
"Hmm..." Karst glanced at the menu. "Give me the strawberry ripple ice cream."<br>
<br>
The man shakily served up the ice creams, then fainted right onto the floor. 
Karst and Agatio just ignored him as they happily ate their ice cream, then left 
the shop. They had forgotten to pay, but the ice cream vendor was hardly going 
to chase down two scary looking people to demand his money.<br>
<br>
"What should we do next?" Agatio pondered, as they walked along a random street.<br>
<br>
"Look at this!" Karst ripped a poster off a wall and brandished it in his face. 
"Tolbi Amusement Park... it's open right now. Let's go to the amusement park!"<br>
<br>
"Aren't we a little old for amusement parks?" Agatio asked, sounding slightly 
exasperated.<br>
<br>
"Come on!" Karst was already pulling him away toward the amusement park. "We 
never got to have that kind of fun in Prox!"<br>
<br>
"I think we were a little too busy blowing stuff up to have fun," Agatio 
muttered. "Why don't we look inside that museum?" He really didn't want to do 
something so embarassing like hanging around children. People would discover his 
soft side. That would not do!<br>
<br>
Karst cried out in rage as Agatio overpowered her and began dragging her toward 
a museum. A museum? Was he insane? The two Proxians entered the dreary building 
and approached a counter. Karst was silently fuming and Agatio wondered how long 
he had to live this time around...<br>
<br>
"So, you wish to take a tour of Tolbi's museum?" The clerk asked. "Hold on, I'll 
call a tour guide. The tickets will be..." As she recited the price, she pushed 
some shiny button and spoke into an intercom. "Tour guide needed to show two 
people around."<br>
<br>
Agatio was about to fork over the money for two museum tickets when the tour 
guide suddenly appeared. The Proxians stared in wide-eyed horror at the familiar 
old man.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Agatio and Karst, what a surprise to see you both," Kraden said, smiling 
pleasantly. "I thought you were both dead. Believe it or not, I decided to take 
a break from studying Alchemy for a while and take up a temporary job here in 
Tolbi. It looks like I will be your guide for the tour. Isn't that quite a 
coincidence?"<br>
<br>
"LET'S GO TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK!" Agatio screamed at the top of his lungs, 
pulling Karst out of the museum at top speed. Kraden broke down into tears and 
the clerk sighed, calling up the manager. "This time, the group didn't even 
bother to buy the tickets before leaving. This is the tenth group Kraden has 
driven away..."<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Agatio and Karst were now at the gates to the amusement park. They 
quickly brought their tickets and walked into the park. Karst immediately 
dragged him to the nearest food stand.<br>
<br>
"We just ate ice cream," Agatio complained, as Karst bought cotton candy, 
popcorn and hot dogs. "Shouldn't we at least try the rides before we eat again?"<br>
<br>
"Don't be so grumpy. Sheesh," Karst muttered, biting into one of the hot dogs. 
She handed the other over to Agatio, who reluctantly took it. Eventually, they 
finished eating. "Okay, let's try the rides now!"<br>
<br>
The first ride they approached was the rollercoaster. A queue of kids were about 
to go on the next ride, but ran away crying for their mommies when they saw the 
scary Proxians. <br>
<br>
Karst would never forget the first and only time she ever got to hear Agatio 
scream like a girl as they went through a series of loops. Apparently he didn't 
quite appreciate his whole world suddenly being turned upside down a number of 
times.<br>
<br>
Then Agatio got his chance to ridicule Karst after she suddenly got frightened 
in the Haunted House. Though she claimed she'd seen a freaky eyeball that 
resembled the Wise One and that was why she had been afraid, Agatio was sure 
he'd got his own back on her.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the amusement park was almost empty now since everyone kept running 
away from Karst and Agatio, and even leaving the park in their fear. The two 
Proxians sat down on a bench, feeling thoroughly tired after all the rides.<br>
<br>
"That was quite fun, wasn't it?" Karst asked chirpily. "I can't believe I've 
been missing out on so much."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I guess it was alright," Agatio mumbled, trying to sound completely 
uninterested.<br>
<br>
"Just one more thing could make this an absolutely perfect day," Karst declared, 
her crimson eyes shining in delight.<br>
<br>
"What?" Agatio asked, turning to gaze at her in confusion.<br>
<br>
Karst then leaned over and kissed him, and the two melted into an embrace. 
People around stopped and stared at the kissing, pointy-eared, red-eyed scaly 
warriors sitting on a bench, but the two Proxians didn't care or didn't notice.</p>
