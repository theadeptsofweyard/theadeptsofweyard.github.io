up for lost time fun?<br>

refreshing and not boring the stories are.<br>

the pairing now. The winner this time is... Isaac/Hama!</p>

<p align="left">Isaac was walking through a thin meadow, staring at the 
butterflies flitting around his head when he spied a sexy little Venus Djinni 
lying under a tree.<br>
<br>
Isaac skipped over to see the dear thing and was shocked to find that she was 
hurt! A thorn had pierced her tiny little arm and she whimpered unhappily with 
the pain.<br>
<br>
"My cute little friend," Isaac said. "Let me help you!" He took out his 
Leatherman Multi-Purpose tool and pulled out the thorn, as carefully as he 
could. The Venus Djinni cried out and Isaac's heart ached to hear her crying out 
in pain so shrilly. "You'll be all right," Isaac whispered. "I'll take care of 
you. I'll call you Hama and you can live with me forever!"<br>
<br>
Scooping Hama up in his arms, Isaac carried her home and made a bed for her 
beside his own. For seven days and seven nights, Isaac nursed Hama, cleaning her 
wound and feeding her Alchemy-brand Venus Djinni chow.<br>
<br>
On the eighth night, Hama climbed into bed with Isaac. She burrowed under the 
covers and happily hugged Isaac's arm. It made Isaac giggle and he cuddled close 
to Hama, stroking her head and singing happily to her.<br>
<br>
They continued that way for a long time. Every day, Isaac hurried home so he 
could curl up with Hama. It gave him an impressive feeling whenever Hama hugged 
his arm.<br>
<br>
Then one night, Hama looked up at Isaac and said, "If you kiss me, I will become 
an attractive princess."<br>
<br>
Isaac screamed in astonishment, he was so surprised. How could a Venus Djinni 
talk? He must have dropped off and dreamed it. Wait, didn't Flint talk too? 
Yeah, he didn't know what he was thinking.<br>
<br>
"You're not dreaming," Hama said. "Kiss me."<br>
<br>
"Don't tell anyone I screamed like that," Isaac said and kissed Hama on her 
head. The air swirled and suddenly, there stood an attractive princess! With a 
crown and everything!<br>
<br>
"I'm Princess Hama," she said. "I was cursed. It's a long story."<br>
<br>
"Is it really you?" Isaac said.<br>
<br>
"See?" Hama said and showed Isaac the scar from the thorn on her arm. Then she 
kissed Isaac and they tumbled on a bed and did a lot of very dirty things, some 
of them involving a helpful book.<br>
<br>
"I love you," Hama said when they were done. Isaac clasped her close and they 
lived together happily ever after on all the princess treasure Hama had stashed 
away.<br>
<br>
And if Hama didn't know about Isaac's visits to the Venus Djinni sanctuary, 
well, it wouldn't hurt her.</p>
