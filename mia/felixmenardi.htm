<p><img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's 
finally time for another story.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Today, we're 
trying something a little different...<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It can't be 
much worse than a three paragraph story.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's still a 
story anyway, however it's written, right?<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right. 
What's the pairing again, Mia?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The winning 
pairing is Felix/Menardi!<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... you 
picked Tundaria for our date?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I 
certainly did. Look at all that snow everywhere. <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm... not 
fond of snow. Why do you like it so much anyway? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, you 
can make sno-cones with it. Here you go. *hands over a paper cone and a syrup 
bottle*<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You came 
here so we could make sno-cones? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. Now 
stop being grumpy and start making yummy sno-cones!<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Meep... 
well, okay. *fills a cone with snow* But what if the snow is dirty? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Stop 
worrying! The snow is nice and clean! *makes self a sno-cone and pours on syrup*
<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really...? 
*makes a sno-cone and nervously tastes it* It tastes okay...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course 
it does! Sheesh, you sure are paranoid. I like it better when you lighten up.
<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really? ._.
<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh huh. 
Now quit being so phobic and eat your sno-cone. <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *eats it* 
... I'm not going to get food poisoning? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Man, 
you're really worked up. Relax a bit, will you? *pelts with snow balls* <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> H-hey! You 
could at least warn me first! <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ah, don't 
be such a baby. Snow is great!<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sick of 
snow... <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really 
now? *brushes snow out of his hair* I think you should try brushing your hair 
more often. <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why should 
I? <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You'd look 
much better without it hanging over your face like that.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's emo 
hair. I like it. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But then I 
can't see those lovely brown eyes of yours well enough... it's such a shame. Why 
don't you wear it back at least once? <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I 
don't need hairstyle tips from women. <br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, okay 
then, how about this? *kisses him*<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is red*<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *smirks* 
Looks like you could do with some snow to cool yourself off now. <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Bleh.
<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^_^ Now 
let's have more sno-cones! <br>
