<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ready for 
another story?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's one of 
those weird short stories again.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yep. Better 
get used to them.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The 
webmistress is lazy, huh?<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It does 
look to be that way, but she's apparently just tired of things...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And when 
you're tired of things, you don't feel like rambling on for pages with a 
romantic story.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's why 
her fanfiction's practically non-existent these days...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But we'll 
continue with the Seaside Getaway of course. The pairing this time is Isaac/Kay!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It snowed a foot overnight one time in Vale. When they woke up, 
the first thing Kay and Isaac did was to go outside together and spend time 
together in the snow. First, they made snow angels. Then they had a snowball 
fight and Kay hit Isaac in the shoulder with a big frosty iceball. It hurt a 
lot, but Kay rubbed his shoulder for him after he complained a little and then 
it was all better.<br>
<br>
Then they decided to make a snow man, which would be far less painful.<br>
<br>
"We'll make a really cool snow man!" Kay said.<br>
<br>
"Why don't we make a snow woman instead?" Isaac said. "That would at least be 
considered politically correct."<br>
<br>
"I know," Kay said. "We can make a snow dog. That way, we don't have to worry 
about gender politics."<br>
<br>
So they rolled the snow up quickly, enjoying their task, and made a fairly 
impressive looking snow dog. Kay put on pieces of coal for the eyes. The dog was 
almost as big as Isaac, since they had been having so much fun rolling up all 
the snow and gone a little overboard.<br>
<br>
"It looks pretty good," Kay said thoughtfully. "But it seems like it's missing 
something."<br>
<br>
"Here," Isaac said and held up his scarf. "I actually have a ton of these in my 
closet." He put the scarf onto the dog's neck.<br>
<br>
It was perfect. For about a minute. Then the dog, even though it was just made 
of snow, started to move and growl like a rather fierce and angry real dog.<br>
<br>
Isaac screamed in terror and ran but the snow dog chased him until he tripped 
over a tree root. Then the snow dog hugged him in a deadly grip. He was too 
freaked out by snow having come to life to actually do anything like cast 
Psynergy.<br>
<br>
"Nobody does that to my little Sexy Flower," Kay screamed. She grabbed an icicle 
and stabbed the snow dog through the head. It fell down and Kay kicked it apart 
until it was just a bunch of snow again.<br>
<br>
"You saved me!" Isaac said with obvious gratitude and they shared an embrace in 
the snow before going in for hot chocolate.<br>
<br>
The scarf lay in the yard until a random child picked it up and took it home. 
Well, Isaac had a ton of them like he said, so it didn't matter.</p>
