not a bad thing.<br>

pairing is... Garet/Feizhi!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Garet paced up and down, staring impatiently at the watch upon 
his wrist. His very good friend, Mary Sue Sparklyravenpoo, had arranged to meet 
him here at the park. "I have something important to tell you," she had said.<br>
<br>
Mary Sue Sparklyravenpoo was several minutes late, which was very unlike her. 
Any moment now, Garet expected to see her bounce up, her glistening hair 
streaming behind her as it shone with all the colours of the rainbow and her 
sparkly eyes aglow with many different hues.<br>
<br>
Garet heard footsteps from behind him, but they seemed rather heavy for a 
delicate and lightweight girl like Mary Sue Sparklyravenpoo, whose tread was so 
quiet he rarely ever heard her coming. He turned around and found Feizhi staring 
at him.<br>
<br>
"What are you doing here?" Feizhi said nervously, raising an eyebrow in 
confusion. "I thought you said you didn't want to see me again."<br>
<br>
Garet had said that after an argument they had which seemed so ridiculous now, 
but now he was beginning to wish he hadn't acted so quickly and said such 
things. "Mary Sue Sparklyravenpoo asked to meet me here." As he gazed at Feizhi, 
his head began to throb intensely.<br>
<br>
"Oh," Feizhi said, flushing in embarrassment and looking down with mild 
disappointment on her face. "I'll just go then."<br>
<br>
"Wait," Garet said quickly and caught Feizhi by her arm before she could turn 
away from him. "I was wrong to say such things. I still love you. Can you ever 
forgive me for what I said?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," Feizhi said, smiling. They wrapped their arms around each other and 
kissed, passion exploding between them like a meteor crashing into the ground 
and showering everything around it with burning flames.<br>
<br>
From behind a large rock, Mary Sue Sparklyravenpoo watched with a devious light 
in her multicoloured eyes. She took a list out of her pocket, and checked off 
"Garet/Feizhi". Then, she skipped off to help an embittered man find love again, 
just as soon as she'd saved the Djinn from extinction.</p>
