<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We had a 
reason for taking this long, right?<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We sure did. 
Some absurd thing to do with 1st April and a weird poll.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, so 
long as it was a good reason...<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And the 
winning pairing is...?<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I shudder to 
think what the next pairing will be.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Relax. It's 
called April Fool's Day for a reason.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... it 
might be a joke poll?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Precisely. And 
now our winning pairing is... Piers/Jenna!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Jenna had been quite surprised when she was woken up in the 
middle of the night by Piers, who was oddly cloaked, and told to disguise 
herself. Though she was a little cranky and angry at being woken up early, the 
sound of Piers's smooth, honeyed voice was enough to calm her down.<br>
<br>
So, they ended up through mysterious fields towards a mysterious location 
wearing mysterious disguises in the middle of the night.<br>
<br>
"Piers," Jenna said, rubbing her eyes. "I thought the date started tomorrow 
afternoon."<br>
<br>
"That's what the OBHL thinks," Piers whispered. "We're going to a different 
location as well. I don't want another crazy fangirl fiasco, thank you very 
much."<br>
<br>
"Well, this had better be good," Jenna said grumpily.<br>
<br>
"Believe me, it will be." Piers smiled.<br>
<br>
So, after a long trek that almost resulted in Jenna losing her temper and 
burning all the nearby vegetation, the sun was just beginning to rise when they 
arrived at the location.<br>
<br>
"A hot spring?" Jenna exclaimed in amazement. "It's beautiful!" The spring was 
clearly lit by fireflies buzzing around in the air.<br>
<br>
"I thought you'd like it," Piers said. "We'll sit in here and watch the sun 
rise, then have a nice little breakfast and find something to do with the next 
day."<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm not complaining," Jenna said, tearing off her clothes. Within 
seconds, she had jumped into the water and re-emerged, shaking her head and 
sighing blissfully.<br>
<br>
Piers slowly undressed and knelt by the water, shivering slightly in the cold 
air. He levered himself in, noticing that Jenna was checking out his chest.<br>
<br>
"Wow..." Jenna murmured, a raptured expression on her face. "Do you work out a 
lot?"<br>
<br>
"I like to keep in shape," Piers replied, swimming over to her and sitting down 
next to her. "The fangirls are quite fond of my muscular body, so I'm told."<br>
<br>
"Hmm." Jenna was currently engrossed in feeling him up and squeezing his chest 
muscles. Piers patiently watched as she poked and rapped his chest. Eventually, 
she got bored of it and leaned against him.<br>
<br>
"The fireflies are so pretty," Jenna said, watching the darting insects. "It's 
so peaceful and quiet. You sure picked a great spot. Not what I was expecting, 
but nice."<br>
<br>
"I like to be original," Piers offered as a means of explanation. "My cooking is 
a fine example..."<br>
<br>
The rest of the night, they talked to each other and watched the fireflies 
dancing on the surface of the spring, undisturbed by fangirls. Eventually, the 
sun rose and they watched it rise.<br>
<br>
"It's morning now," Piers said. "We should have our breakfast."<br>
<br>
"Did you bring some?" Jenna asked.<br>
<br>
"Yes. Don't worry, I wasn't too inventive," Piers said with a smile.<br>
<br>
After they had got out of the spring and dressed, Piers laid out a blanket on 
the ground for Jenna to sit on then he sat as well, putting out the food.<br>
<br>
"Chocolate filled buns topped with honey and oats," Piers said, placing a tasty 
looking bun in front of Jenna. "Try it."<br>
<br>
It was rather odd. Jenna had never had chocolate and honey together, but she 
made the effort and ate it. Though her teeth hurt afterward, so she was only 
able to manage two of them.<br>
<br>
"What would you like to do today?" Piers asked.<br>
<br>
"Um... shopping trip in Kalay!" Jenna said excitedly. "They have the best 
clothes. There are these beautiful silk dresses... and I really want one... 
we're not too far from there, are we?"<br>
<br>
"Sure." Piers feared for his wallet but he was happy to please. The fangirls 
would always give him more money if he asked. They would do anything for him. 
"Let's go."<br>
<br>
After packing up, they headed off, managing to keep out of sight of rabid 
fangirls searching for Piers as they trekked to Kalay for the shopping trip of a 
lifetime.</p>
