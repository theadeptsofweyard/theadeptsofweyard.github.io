on the 'seaside' part anyway? The couples hardly ever go to the seaside...<br>

the pairing, Mia?<br>

pairing is... Felix/Feizhi!</p>

Felix stood outside the run-down looking house, an astonished expression on his 
face. This was where he was going to be for his date? If he listened hard 
enough, he was sure he could hear ghostly screams coming from inside. The 
frightened Venus Adept wanted to turn tail and run, but he couldn't abandon his 
date.<br>
<br>
"D-do we r-really have to stay here overnight?" asked a timid voice. "It is a 
terrifying house. I am getting the bad feeling from this."<br>
<br>
"Me too," Felix murmured, steeling himself. "Me too... but we have no choice. 
Our friends arranged for us to stay here. They paid and everything."<br>
<br>
"Oh, well, if I see evil spirits, then I can use my kung fu to destroy them," 
Feizhi said hopefully, a flicker of a smile appearing on her pale face. She 
hoisted her bag over her shoulder. "Let us go to see what is inside."<br>
<br>
"Alright..." Felix slowly approached the wooden door, noticing that one of its 
hinges was broken and it was actually hanging across the doorway. He pushed it 
aside and winced as it crashed against the wall, the last hinge breaking free. 
"Uh... this house seems to be in need of repair."<br>
<br>
"It smells rather dusty," Feizhi commented, wrinkling her nose as they stepped 
into the house. She looked around and then gasped, her eyes locking on another 
pair of eyes that certainly did not belong to the person with her. "Ah!"<br>
<br>
"What's wrong?" Felix looked at her then turned, looking at a creepy looking 
portrait of a woman with a menacing grin. "Uh...?"<br>
<br>
"I... I thought there really was a woman there for a moment," Feizhi explained, 
recovering from the shock. "It is a rather realistic portrait. I even feel like 
I am being watched."<br>
<br>
The two walked along the corridor, the floorboards creaking ominously under 
their feet. Suddenly, a bat screeched and flew out of nowhere. It proceeded to 
flap around their heads before heading outside. Feizhi had already screamed and 
jumped on Felix at this point.<br>
<br>
"It's just a bat..." Felix assured her. "They don't hurt anyone, so long as you 
just<br>
stay away from them."<br>
<br>
"But it was very frightening!" Feizhi exclaimed, stepping back and flushing. "It 
came out of nowhere, flapping around like an evil spirit. I was not prepared for 
it."<br>
<br>
"I wasn't either," Felix muttered. Just how had they found this place anyway? 
When this date was over, he was going to have a word or two with whoever set him 
up in this hole. "I can only hope there aren't any other strange creatures 
waiting in here to ambush us."<br>
<br>
"Be careful what you say. We may get jinxed," Feizhi whispered in alarm, looking 
around furtively. A howl came from somewhere, causing them to jump. Of course, 
it was just some noisy dog outside, but inside this house, it naturally sounded 
creepy and spooky.<br>
<br>
"I think we've had too many surprises already..." Felix sighed. "This isn't 
going to be easy."<br>
<br>
"Well, let's just hope we don't have heart attacks," Feizhi quipped.<br>
<br>
The house was fairly small. There was only one bedroom, but at least it had two 
single beds. There didn't seem to be much to do in the house apart from be 
scared, so they settled for sitting in the lounge among cobwebs, spiders and 
dust, trying to find things to talk about. Every so often, their conversations 
would be interrupted by screams, bumps in the dark, or some random scary noise 
that struck terror into their hearts.<br>
<br>
Somehow, they survived the day and settled down in the kitchen for dinner. They 
were nervous about eating in a dusty, strange smelling house, but it probably 
wasn't going to affect the food. The food at least tasted fine.<br>
<br>
The evening somehow managed to be much creepier than the daytime, especially 
since it was getting dark. The two very frightened teens clutched each other on 
the sofa as they listened to even more screeches, wails, strange sounding bumps 
and the fluttering of wings.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the stress proved too much and they were so exhausted, they fell 
asleep in each other's arms on the couch.</p>
