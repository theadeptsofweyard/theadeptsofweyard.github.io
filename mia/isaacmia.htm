Isaac/Mia! </i></b>Without further ado, we'll present the Mudshippers with a 
nice story about Isaac and I going to the Seaside Getaway!</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Seagulls 
flew in the air, screeching like crazy and aiming to drop their little white 
missiles on every crab that scuttled across the sand. An old man sat on the 
beach playing a fiddle and singing about pink rabbits at the top of his voice. 
There were acres of golden sand that seemed to run on for eternity, until they 
stopped abruptly and then there was green grass (as opposed to blue, purple or 
red grass naturally) and a little footpath.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">This 
little footpath ran all the way up to some steps going upwards. The steps were 
carved stone, and had handrails. The steps came to a porch, and there was a 
large, wooden door with a knocker. The house was small and wooden, and of 
course, it was a lot more homely than a stone castle with a door that seemed to 
only slam as soon as somebody stepped over the threshold.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Two 
people were walking up the path towards the house, each of them dragging a bag. 
One of them was a boy with blond, spiky hair and a yellow scarf, his own 
trademark. The other one was a blue-haired girl, wearing heavy robes, despite 
the fact that it was very warm and she was sweating a little.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"How 
come we never carried any bags on our journey?" Mia suddenly wondered, rather 
than stare at the house.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
"Convenience, maybe," Isaac tilted his head. "Do you hear music? It sounds 
like... a violin or something. Where is it coming from?"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"The 
beach, I think," Mia frowned. "I think someone's singing about rabbits."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Well, 
rabbits are cute."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Have 
you ever seen a <i>pink</i> rabbit?"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Um... 
well, maybe it's a very rare breed."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Sure, 
Isaac, sure. I just hope he doesn't play at night as well."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"We paid 
a thousand gold for this place. It should be worth it."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"That 
place looks a bit small to be worth a thousand gold," Mia trundled up the steps 
and stopped to catch her breath on the porch. "Are you sure we weren't ripped 
off?"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Oh, 
Mia, we can trust Proxian Lovers Company," Isaac smiled and gripped the 
doorknob, which immediately fell off in his hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<i>Proxian 
Lovers?!"</i></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Well, 
er," Isaac gave the door a fierce push and it opened. "I was desperate!"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"The 
door doesn't even have a lock," Mia followed Isaac inside. "We're going to be 
burgled."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"By who, 
Mia?" Isaac smiled winningly.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Maybe 
whoever is now singing about orange blue tits?" Mia suggested, her voice going 
dangerously low. Isaac recognised this as a sign that she was about to verge on 
the brink of violence. "Whoah, Mia, calm down! It's not that bad! Hey... let's 
check out the bedrooms."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">...</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Bedroom<i>s</i>, 
Isaac?"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"That's 
funny. I could have sworn they said bedrooms... but, come to think of it, the 
agent was wearing a 'I love Saturos forever' badge, and she did look at me a 
little evilly the whole time."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"One 
bedroom..." Mia started shaking. "With a double bed?!"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"I can 
take the floor," Isaac backed away. "You can have the whole bed to yourself."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<i>We've 
been tricked by a Proxian lover, who hates you for defeating Saturos, into 
buying a house with only one bedroom, with only a double bed, and the house 
doesn't have a lock!"</i></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"I can 
sleep on the floor," Isaac nodded furiously, wondering how long it would take 
before she started to throw things. "Take the bed, Mia."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Oh, 
no!" Mia gasped, calming down and slipping back into normal Mia mode. "That 
wouldn't be fair, would it... we came here to have a good time and be 
comfortable. One of us can't sleep on the floor. Maybe... we should just share 
the bed."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"Mia?" 
Isaac stepped forwards. "It doesn't matter..."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"No, 
it's okay," Mia shook her head. "We trust each other, and neither of us is a 
lecherous pervert, so we can at least be comfortable together right?" She 
managed a half smile. "Besides, we came here to make shippers happy, after 
all..."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"... 
Okay then," Isaac blinked. "Let's check out the rest of the house, then we'll 
unpack."</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Isaac 
and Mia went on a tour of the house, although there really wasn't so much to 
see. There was a bathroom, kitchen, sitting room and a conservatory, from where 
they had a nice view of the beach, and unfortunately, the crazy old man playing 
the fiddle.</p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Isaac, you don't have a bow and 
arrow, do you?" Mia suddenly asked.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Um, no, I don't," Isaac said 
oddly. "Let's go and unpack now."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"No, let's go shopping," Mia said 
fiercely. "I want that bow and arrow."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Mia," Isaac took her gently by 
the arm. "That's murder, you know."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"No," Mia grimaced and pointed at 
the fiddle player. "THAT'S murder... of my sanity!"</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"You had sanity?" Isaac blurted 
out. "Uh, I mean... yeah, I'm gonna go unpack now!" He hurried away before Mia 
could reach for the nearest heavy object and clobber him.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
The rest of the day was somewhat 
uneventful sadly. Isaac was scared of Mia and Mia was in one of her dangerous 
moods. They did consider going to the beach until Isaac found a rolled up copy 
of a newspaper which identified the beach as a landfill site and a radioactive 
waste dump site. He told Mia, but kept out the part about radioactive waste. It 
only served to make her even madder.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
Isaac tried to make a romantic 
supper for him and Mia, but the candles kept falling over and eventually the 
napkins caught fire. Mia came in to put out the fire and Isaac gave up in 
frustration and they ate sandwiches. The fiddler player was still playing the 
fiddle and singing a ballad about a boy who loved oranges until he betrayed them 
by deciding he preferred bananas. Apparently the oranges and bananas went to war 
and the boy got turned into a cabbage in the middle of the conflict.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Mia, I'm sorry about this mess," 
Isaac hesitated. "I shouldn't have gone to Proxian Lovers."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"No, you shouldn't have," Mia 
shook her head. "I would love to forgive you but it's just hard right now. I'm 
sorry."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Well, you'll forgive me later, 
right?" Isaac asked.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Sure," Mia narrowed her eyes as 
she heard a suspicious squeaking. "Is that a rat?"</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Oh, I found a couple rats 
earlier," Isaac gulped. "I gave them names. I called them Whiskers and Fangs. 
Well, he bit me, so that's why I named him Fangs. Teeth didn't sound right, and 
I already named a mouse Biter."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Mice?" Mia put down her food. 
"That's unhygenic! Mice and rats everywhere..."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Eh, blame the Proxians," Isaac 
chewed his food. "It's all their fault anyway."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
There was nothing else to do so 
Isaac and Mia went to bed after supper.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"It's cold," Mia shivered. "I 
think there's a draught somewhere. Why am I not surprised?"</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Here, let me warm you up," Isaac 
suggested.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Uh..." Mia hesitated. "Well... 
okay!" She moved over and snuggled up to Isaac. They lay together like that, 
snuggled up to each other, and found that it was very enjoyable indeed.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"I like it like this," Mia looked 
up, blushing. "We should do it more often, shouldn't we?"</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Huh? You mean snuggle up like 
this?" Isaac looked at her. "Yeah... we should."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"I think I'll forgive you for a 
bit."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
"Well, I'm not complaining."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span lang="en-us">
And then Isaac and Mia melted into 
a passionate kiss. And then they fell asleep in each other's arms. And 
Mudshippers screamed in fury at the lack of a hentai scene. And the fiddler was 
eaten by a giant wave of radioactive waste. And everybody lived happily ever 
after. </span></p>
