It is my proud duty to announce we finally have the next 
episode ready. <br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Great! I 
swear Caz is way too slow with these things! <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who's the 
unfortunate couple this time around? <br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Are you 
saying my Seaside Getaway is bad? <br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> N-no! I... 
I... AAAAHHHHH!!!!! *runs* <br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He must have 
received the tip-off it was your time of the month, Mia. <br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> How do they 
find these things out? <br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because you 
announce it by swinging around that mace! o_o;;; <br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And she gets 
more violent too. <br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* I don't 
have time for this. The next couple to go is... *opens envelope* <i>Isaac/Jenna!
</i>This one's for you, Valeshippers!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">"I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts 
sitting in a row, dee dee..." Jenna sang, skipping up along the path to the 
large house that lay ahead of them. She did not even notice, nor did she care, 
about the clouds gathering above the roof or the bats fluttering around the 
topmost peak.</p>
<p align="left">"Hmm, they didn't say anything about 
bats," Isaac struggled after Jenna, pulling a strangely large amount of baggage 
along with him. How odd that he had a lot and Jenna had none at all. Very odd 
indeed. The truth was, Isaac had suddenly become Jenna's slave and she was 
paying him absolutely zilch. And he'd paid the ridiculous sum of money for this 
place too!</p>
<p align="left">"Huh? Who's they?" Jenna stopped, one foot 
on the doorstep, as she looked around at Isaac.</p>
<p align="left">"King Stephen Travel Co," Isaac responded. 
"And I don't have a clue who King Stephen is meant to be either."</p>
<p align="left">"Hmm, Lemuria had a king," Jenna tapped 
her chin. "But his name was Hydros, not Stephen."</p>
<p align="left">"I figured," Isaac dropped the bags with a 
huge sigh of relief and fumbled in his pocket for a key. He produced it with a 
flourish and unlocked the door. Of course, Jenna bounded in without even 
bothering to pick up a bag. The very traumatised Venus Adept groaned his way in, 
hearing Jenna's cries of "This place has this! And that! And a ton of those! And 
such a pretty statue! Hey, wow! There's a wall covered in blood! And look at 
this axe! And a corpse in the bath!"</p>
<p align="left">Isaac, who was currently unpacking, gasped 
and rushed to the bathroom where Jenna was gleefully looking at the bath.</p>
<p align="left">"Did you say... a corpse in the bath?" 
Isaac swallowed nervously. Did he even dare to look?</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah, a dead spider," Jenna shrugged. 
"Poor spider."</p>
<p align="left">"Don't DO that!" Isaac wailed, putting a 
hand over his chest. His heart was hammering like crazy. How silly had he been 
to expect something so absurd? Selling houses with bodies in them, that was 
hardly going to improve their reputation.</p>
<p align="left">Jenna looked at him then giggled. "Silly 
Isaac! What did you think I meant?"</p>
<p align="left">"Uh, um," Isaac frantically tried to think 
up an excuse. "I thought you said... porpoise. I'm deathly allergic to 
porpoise."</p>
<p align="left">"But I heard you ask if I said corpse in 
the bath," Jenna frowned.</p>
<p align="left">"No, no, I said porpoise," Isaac chuckled 
lamely. "Really. I hate porpoise."</p>
<p align="left">"Want to see the blood covered wall?" 
Jenna grabbed Isaac by the hand and led him out of the bathroom and into another 
room. She noticed that the walls were completely clean and frowned in 
puzzlement. "Weird. There was blood before."</p>
<p align="left">"Sure, and there's a corridor with blood 
just rushing into it somewhere," Isaac grinned.</p>
<p align="left">"A corridor with blood flowing through 
it," Jenna looked dreamy. "That is so cool. Like it should be in a horror story. 
There ought to be a horror story with corridors full of blood."</p>
<p align="left">"I'm going to finish unpacking," Isaac 
left Jenna to her gory fantasies.</p>
<p align="left">Fortunately, the rest of the day passed 
without any nasty, unexpected surprises. A bat screeched occasionally, but other 
than that, it was uneventful.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately for Isaac, supper wasn't so 
pleasant.</p>
<p align="left">Jenna frowned as Isaac rolled on the 
floor, choking and gasping.</p>
<p align="left">"Isaac?" Jenna spoke tentatively. "Didn't 
you like the chicken?"</p>
<p align="left">"It's... spicy..." Isaac coughed, his eyes 
welling up with tears. "How much pepper did you use?"</p>
<p align="left">"A lot!" Jenna beamed. "It's my Spicy 
Chicken Surprise!"</p>
<p align="left">"It's spicer than anything I've ever 
eaten," Isaac struggled back into his chair and gulped down water.</p>
<p align="left">"That's the surprise," Jenna winked.</p>
<p align="left">After supper, Jenna mysteriously vanished, 
muttering about a cellar, and Isaac lay on his bed, trying to recover from the 
effects of the Spicy Chicken Surprise.</p>
<p align="left">"Yo," A strange voice came out of nowhere.</p>
<p align="left">Isaac frowned, turned his head and let out 
a yell of shock. A weird man in a suit was standing next to the bed. Even worse, 
he was all transparent and ghostly looking.</p>
<p align="left">"What are you?" Isaac demanded, leaping 
off the bed and looking around for a weapon. Oh wait, the man was transparent.</p>
<p align="left">"I am a ghost," The man waved his hands. "Woooooooo."</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah, yeah," Isaac shrugged, unimpressed 
by his ghost act. "What's the deal, Casper?"</p>
<p align="left">"My name is not Casper," The man snapped. 
"I saw what happened at supper. What an unfortunate incident. I believe you 
should correct your friend if you don't mind my saying so."</p>
<p align="left">"Hmm," Isaac tapped his chin thoughtfully. 
"I know! I'll get rid of the pepper shaker! Thanks for the tip!" He ran out of 
the bedroom before the man could say anything else.</p>
<p align="left">"That's not what I meant," The ghost man 
wailed before vanishing with an almighty POOF.</p>
<p align="left">Isaac discreetly got rid of the pepper 
shaker, praying desperately that Jenna didn't have a secret stash of them hidden 
away somewhere, and then he went to look for Jenna.</p>
<p align="left">He certainly didn't expect to find her 
laughing and hiccuping while writing on a wall.</p>
<p align="left">"Jenna," Isaac yelped. "What are you 
doing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, hey, Isaac," Jenna laughed drunkenly as she 
grabbed a bottle lying next to her and took a swig. "Look at what I wrote!"</p>
<p>Isaac noticed a pile of bottles lying nearby, some of 
them already empty, and then his gaze swung to Jenna's messy scribbles 
decorating the wall. She had been writing 'BREAD DRUM' all over the walls, over 
and over.</p>
<p>"There were voices in my head saying Redrum," Jenna 
giggled. "So I looked in the cellar but I couldn't find any red rum. So, I just 
took the bottles of rum and put red food colouring in them, so now they were red 
rum! Then I started drinking from the bottles and it tasted really good, then 
the voices wanted me to write on the wall. I think they were saying 'Bread Drum' 
but I'm not really sure."</p>
<p>"Come on, Jenna, you're drunk," Isaac gently pulled her 
away from the wall. She sagged into his arms, clearly unable to stand. "Oh man, 
how many bottles did you have?"</p>
<p>"I don't feel very good," Jenna moaned, before she 
hurled all over the floor. Isaac winced.</p>
<p>In the space of five minutes, Jenna was put to bed with 
a cold flannel and Isaac cleared up the mess. Well, not the writing on the wall, 
he didn't like the wallpaper anyway. Now he was sitting by Jenna's bed and 
wetting her forehead.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling any better?" Isaac asked.</p>
<p>"I have a headache," Jenna said faintly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm not surprised," Isaac said sympathetically. 
"You drank seven bottles of rum."</p>
<p>"Red rum," Jenna pressed. "Rum with red food 
colouring."</p>
<p>"Same difference," Isaac replied. "Well, I guess I'm 
going to head off to sleep..."</p>
<p>"Isaac..."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Can you stay with me tonight?" Jenna turned her wide 
eyes on him with the biggest puppydog look she could muster.</p>
<p>"I... alright," Isaac agreed. He couldn't resist that 
look, and especially not when Jenna was under the weather from all that rum.</p>
<p>A minute later, he was lying in the bed next to Jenna 
and had a very red face.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Jenna murmured, suddenly rolling over and 
wrapping her arms around him. She relaxed and closed her eyes, willing sleep to 
come.</p>
<p>Isaac looked down at her in surprise, before he smiled 
and put an arm around her, resting his chin on her head. He closed his eyes and 
also waited to go to sleep.</p>
<p>"REDRUM!" The house suddenly boomed all dramatic-like.</p>
<p>"I'm going to sue King Stephen Travel Co for giving us 
an alcoholic house," Isaac muttered, before drifting off to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, Isaac awoke and sat up, stretching 
out his arms and yawning. It was a beautiful morning and birds were fighting 
with the bats.</p>
<p>Jenna stirred next to him and opened her eyes, a smile 
spreading across her face.</p>
<p>"Good morning," Isaac grinned at her. "How are you 
feeling?"</p>
<p>"Still got a bit of a headache," Jenna sat up, smiling 
sheepishly. "Guess I shouldn't have drunk all that rum. Thanks for helping me 
out last night."</p>
<p>"Eh, it was nothing-" Isaac was cut off as Jenna kissed 
him on the mouth, before getting out of bed. He stared at the door as she 
skipped out of it, smiling even though his face was red again.</p>
<p>"Breakfast time!" Jenna's voice called out to him. "How 
about spicy frosted flakes?"</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Isaac exclaimed, pursuing her into the kitchen. 
"Are you serious?"</p>
<p>"No, silly," Jenna giggled. "I was just kidding. How 
about pancakes?"</p>
<p>"Pancakes are fine," Isaac smiled, hoping that Jenna 
wouldn't find out the pepper shaker was missing for a while. The day had already 
got off to a perfect start.</p>
