<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alright! 
It's finally time for a new story!<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's sure 
getting lazy with the site...<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If we poke 
her enough, she updates eventually.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It can take a 
lot of poking though.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> If poking 
doesn't work, we just set her on fire. ^_^<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Setting Caz 
on fire is fun!<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Don't get 
carried away...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It is my 
pleasure to announce the winning pairing... Felix/Kay! (That's Garet's sister 
for the unaware...)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Felix trudged along the path, a bag slung over his shoulder. It 
was time for a date with some mystery woman, who had apparently picked the place 
out before hand, and he was to go to some place oddly named Flower Power 
Cottage. Felix wanted to find the person who came up with the name and beat them 
senseless with frozen fish. What kind of a name was <i>that</i>? It made him 
feel physically sick. As he noticed the masses of flowers at either side of the 
path and smelled a heavy, sweet scent in the air, he wanted to be even more 
sick.</p>
<p align="left">"Oh, great," Felix sighed, closing his eyes and wandering toward 
the edge of the path without looking where he was going. "I think I'm on a date 
with a flower-obsessed-"</p>
<p align="left">"LOOK OUT!"</p>
<p align="left">Felix was quite surprised to be knocked off his feet by an 
unexpected, oncoming person and he hit the ground with a thud. He blinked, quite 
dazed, as he stared up at the sky. What the heck had just happened? Had some 
girl just screamed to look out and had he been hit by someone?</p>
<p align="left">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p align="left">"Well, I'm not hurt..." Felix began, sitting up.</p>
<p align="left">"Not you, dummy! The flowers!"</p>
<p align="left">Felix blinked, staring at the red-haired girl who was currently 
looking concerned as she gazed at some flowers. So it was Kay, Garet's sister. 
He really should have realised it sooner, now that he thought about it.</p>
<p align="left">"You nearly stepped on them!" Kay looked at Felix with a light 
frown. "Flowers have to be looked after and cared for. They certainly should not 
be trod underfoot."</p>
<p align="left">"Okay, okay. Sorry," Felix said, exhaling heavily. Kay really 
was serious about flowers, wasn't she? "So, you know, we're on a date right now, 
aren't we?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yes! Let's do the one thing I enjoy most," Kay said, smiling 
brightly. "Watch me name the flowers. It's a really fun game."</p>
<p align="left">Felix stared, wide-eyed, sitting on the path next to his bag as 
Kay began to name flowers at great length and even went on to say their 
scientific names. Realising that she was not going to stop, he got up and began 
to walk toward the cottage with an exasperated look on his face.</p>
<p align="left">"Hey! Wait!" Kay got up and ran after him, laughing slightly. "I 
was just teasing. I wasn't really going to name all the flowers. Do you really 
think I'm that crazy?"</p>
<p align="left">Felix stared at her earnestly smiling face then inclined his 
head in a slight nod. "Yeah."</p>
<p align="left">Kay's entire expression changed to a fuming one and she pouted. 
"What kind of way is that to talk to a girl?"</p>
<p align="left">"I just feel suicidal right now," Felix muttered. "So don't you 
think Flower Power Cottage is the lamest, cheesiest name ever?"</p>
<p align="left">"Hey, I only picked it because the brochure said it had 
beautiful flower gardens!" Kay cried out defensively. "Besides, the name doesn't 
matter anyway. It's what the house is like inside!"</p>
<p align="left">Felix shuddered, scarcely wanting to imagine what it was like 
inside. "Do I want to go inside?"</p>
<p align="left">"Well, we can hardly have our date outside and stay out here all 
night, can we?" Kay said in a slow monotone.</p>
<p align="left">"You know... you have a great point!" Felix chuckled awkwardly, 
turning and walking to the cottage. Kay followed behind with a slightly sulky 
expression, and the two entered the cottage. The first thing Felix noticed was 
that the walls were decorated with flowers and there were vases of flowers 
everywhere. He looked down and almost vomited at the sight of the pink carpet 
decorated with black roses. "That carpet..."</p>
<p align="left">"The carpets weren't shown in the brochure," Kay deadpanned, 
keeping her eyes up as she walked away. "Anyway, go put your stuff in your room 
and come down. We'll find something to do while we're here."</p>
<p align="left">Felix really didn't want to spend a night in a room decorated 
from top to bottom with flowers, even with flower paintings on the wall, but it 
looked like he had no choice. He promised himself that when the date was over, 
he would do something very manly to compensate for this. So he slung his bag on 
the flower-patterned bed and headed out of his room, going downstairs to see 
where Kay was.</p>
<p align="left">He found Kay sitting in front of a television on a pile of 
beanbags and staring at a pile of videos.</p>
<p align="left">"Videos?" Felix sat down next to her. "Are there any cool action 
movies? I like cool action movies."</p>
<p align="left">"Actually, no. They all seem to be about nature," Kay sighed. 
"And we can't get any channels on the TV either. This is horrible."</p>
<p align="left">"We should find that travel agency and give them a piece of our 
minds," Felix said, sighing.</p>
<p align="left">"I did see some interesting picture books with flowers in them 
on the bookshelf," Kay said, gesturing at the shelf against the wall. "Actually, 
that's all there was."</p>
<p align="left">"Well... maybe we should watch those videos," Felix said 
eventually, though he didn't actually want to, but it sounded better than 
staring at a wall.</p>
<p align="left">"Really?" Kay smiled. "Is that really okay?"</p>
<p align="left">"It's better than nothing," Felix replied.</p>
<p align="left">Halfway through the first video, they fell asleep in each 
other's arms. It was quite comfortable too. And thus they slumbered like that as 
the video droned on about plants and then it finally came to an end.</p>
<p align="left">Kay stirred, a smile on her face as she pressed her face into 
his soft warm chest. "Mmm..."</p>
<p align="left">"Uh..." Felix opened his eyes a crack, seeing nothing but bright 
red hair. "Did we fall asleep?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah. But we had a nice nap... right?" Kay looked up, gazing 
into his chocolate eyes.</p>
<p align="left">"It was a good nap," Felix agreed. smiling sleepily.</p>
<p align="left">"I think it's time to eat now," Kay said, sitting up and yawning 
as she rubbed her eyes. "Too bad. I was enjoying it."</p>
<p align="left">"So, you'll cook?" Felix rubbed his rumbling stomach. "I hope 
flowers aren't edible because that's all that might be in the larder."</p>
<p align="left">"No, silly," Kay said, giggling slightly. "I'm sure there's 
completely ordinary food in there."</p>
<p align="left">Thankfully, the food in there was quite normal, much to Felix's 
relief as they dined on some completely ordinary dish and had very ordinary 
dessert (nothing crazy like flower flavoured ice cream, thank goodness.) Then 
the evening was spent outside, watching the view as the sun began to set.</p>
<p align="left">"We had a nice time, right?" Kay asked, staring up at the stars.</p>
<p align="left">"I liked it," Felix said. "Even if we didn't do that much."</p>
<p align="left">"Well, the most important thing was spending time together, 
right?" Kay smiled at him. "That's what we came for."</p>
<p align="left">"That was definitely the best part," Felix agreed, staring 
intently at her.</p>
<p align="left">"We should do it again," Kay said, staring back.</p>
<p align="left">Then they melted into a embrace underneath the stars. Though 
they didn't go so far as to sharing a room that night, but things were promising 
for them at any rate.</p>
