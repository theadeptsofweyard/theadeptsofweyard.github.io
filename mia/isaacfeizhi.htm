We're updating quicker this time around.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Compensation 
for taking a month, you could say.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure 
nobody's complaining.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I have a 
complaint. Nobody likes me.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You... don't 
pair up with people very well...<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course, 
everybody's queuing up to be with me! I rock!<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You sure 
aren't modest, Isaac.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Enough 
bickering. The winning pairing is... Isaac/Feizhi!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Feizhi hoisted her bag over her shoulder, 
looking up in anticipation at Lama Temple looming in front of her. Master Hama 
had come over recently and told Feizhi she had won some prize, which involved 
having a date with a mystery person and they could stay at the Lama Temple. The 
monks had been shooed away for their privacy. Feizhi was a little confused since 
she could not remember having entered a contest or anything, but nevertheless, 
she looked forward to it. </p>
<p align="left">Feizhi reached the door and pushed it 
open, stepping into the small building. As she closed the door behind her, she 
dropped her bag and looked around. Had she got here first? "Hello?" Feizhi 
called out.</p>
<p align="left">"Hey," Isaac said, popping out from behind 
a screen and startling Feizhi. "There's lots of llama stuff behind here. Master 
Hama must really love those things."</p>
<p align="left">"Er... yeah..." Feizhi put a hand over her 
chest, trying to still her hammering heart. "Do I know you?"</p>
<p align="left">Isaac blinked.</p>
<p align="left">"Wait... you're not Isaac, are you?" 
Feizhi's jaw dropped.</p>
<p align="left">"Well... I'm certainly not Felix..." Isaac 
murmured. "You don't remember faces very well, do you?"</p>
<p align="left">"OMIGOSH! I'M ON A DATE WITH ISAAC!" 
Feizhi screamed, bouncing around the temple in an ecstasy. "I CAN'T BELIEVE 
THIS!"</p>
<p align="left">Isaac instinctively ducked behind the 
screen and crouched down, feeling quite scared now. He'd never guessed that 
Feizhi could be a psychotic fangirl in disguise. Was she psychotic? He sure 
hoped not. Eventually, Feizhi quietened down and Isaac nervously peeped out from 
behind the screen, looking at the crazed purple-haired girl. How could one of 
his craziest fangirls not even remember what he looked like? It didn't make much 
sense. And mistaking Felix for him, even from behind? It was crazy. They looked 
nothing alike!</p>
<p align="left">"Isaac?" Feizhi tilted her head. "Are you 
okay?"</p>
<p align="left">Maybe he had been around Mia too much. It 
must be affecting him. He was getting paranoid. Isaac let out a dry chuckle and 
came out from behind the screen. "Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry about that... I just 
kind of get a little bit nervous around girls."</p>
<p align="left">"So, you're the shy type, huh?" Feizhi 
giggled. "You did seem to be the quietest out of that group."</p>
<p align="left">How true that was. How so very true.</p>
<p align="left">"Well... to be honest... I stopped being 
so quiet, but okay..." Isaac said. Nobody had forgiven him for transforming from 
a quiet, reserved warrior to an "annoying chatterbox" as some people so rudely 
put it. From now on, he resolved to be true to his original personality, because 
nobody had liked that new one Camelot had come up with anyway! </p>
<p align="left">"Ok..." Feizhi looked a little puzzled. 
"You know... Master Hama has a garden with llamas in it out back. Want to come 
and see?"</p>
<p align="left">"Sure," Isaac said.</p>
<p align="left">They headed out back and walked into a 
large, grassy field where white and brown creatures roamed the field all day, 
spitting and staring as they went about their daily chores.</p>
<p align="left">Isaac felt the hairs rise on the back of 
his neck and shivered. There was something distinctly unsettling about thirty 
pairs of eyes on him. He knew it was thirty because he had counted. All the 
llamas were intently staring at him and Feizhi as they walked through the field 
and it really creeped him out.</p>
<p align="left">"Be careful," Feizhi warned. "Llamas spit 
quite a bit. They won't hurt you, but if you don't want to be covered in 
spit..."</p>
<p align="left">Isaac had no desire to be covered in spit 
so he warily kept his distance from the llamas, wondering how Hama could 
possibly like them so much. </p>
<p align="left">"Erm..." Isaac decided to have a 
conversation. "Thanks for that ring."</p>
<p align="left">"Oh, you got it?" Feizhi brightened. "Did 
you like it?"</p>
<p align="left">"I got it eventually, sometime after we 
finished the journey," Isaac said, shaking his head. Jenna had suddenly come up 
with him with a ring and told him some girl made it for him and gave it to them 
a couple of months ago. They had just... forgotten about it. "It would have been 
useful, I'm sure."</p>
<p align="left">"Well... at least you got it," Feizhi 
said.</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah. Who's Ulmuch?" Isaac asked.</p>
<p align="left">Feizhi looked blankly at him. "Ulmuch?"</p>
<p align="left">"Jenna said something about an Ulmuch and 
paying a favour," Isaac said. "I wondered if maybe she was just making stuff up 
or something. Ulmuch? It sounds like some sort of... I don't know, a swamp 
monster type thing."</p>
<p align="left">Feizhi giggled. "You're funny. Yeah... it 
was weird. I remember now. For some odd reason, I called Hsu Ulmuch. Isn't that 
weird?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah. Very weird," replied Isaac. "Hama 
putting an extra m in her name was a little odd too."</p>
<p align="left">"Aww!" Feizhi cried, rushing up to a baby 
llama. "It's so cute!"</p>
<p align="left">"Wow, that is cute," Isaac said, kneeling 
down next to her and petting the llama. It promptly spat a giant wad of saliva 
in his face. "Ew!"</p>
<p align="left">"Didn't see that coming?" Feizhi held out 
a silk handkerchief. "Here."</p>
<p align="left">"Thanks," muttered Isaac, taking it and 
wiping his face. "Those things are evil."</p>
<p align="left">"Master Hama really likes them though," 
Feizhi said. "I bet the place was really meant to be Llama Temple, but they 
spelled it wrong."</p>
<p align="left">"I wouldn't be surprised if that was the 
case," Isaac said.</p>
<p align="left">After spending some more time among the 
llamas and talking, the two returned to Lama Temple to snack on food that Hama 
had left behind for them. </p>
<p align="left">"This has been a lot of fun," Feizhi said, 
finishing off a slice of bread and cheese. "I enjoyed it."</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah, so did I." Isaac smiled.</p>
<p align="left">There wasn't much to do in the temple so 
they simply talked some more and improvised until night fell and they began to 
get tired, so they curled up on makeshift beds for the night they would spend in 
Lama Temple.</p>
<p align="left">"Night, Isaac," Feizhi said, closing her 
eyes.</p>
<p align="left">"Goodnight," Isaac replied, yawning widely 
as he rolled over and willed himself to sleep.</p>
