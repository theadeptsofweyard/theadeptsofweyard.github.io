Those Proxians have some really strange names.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Yeah... it's hard to figure out where they are getting their names from.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
I wonder what their baby name book would look like if they had one...<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
Apparently it's not really all that random after all.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Kyarorain did some research a while back, with some help, to find out the hidden 
meanings behind their names.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
Now she's compiled it all into a nice essay.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> 
Prepare to be stunned by the stuff you see here.<br>

It certainly hurt my brain. Now I've got these freaky images in my mind... 
*shudder*</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Saturos- </b>Romanized as Satyuros in Japanese. Obviously, the name is 
derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr">Satyr</a>. The Satyrs were a troop of males who accompanied Pan and 
Dionysus. They would roam woods and mountains. Mythology often associates them 
with sex drives and vase painters would portray them with... well, let's just 
say vase painters were very perverted and leave it at that. Dionysus's satyrs 
are lovers of wine and women, and are always ready for physical pleasure, plus 
they enjoyed dancing.</p>
<p><b>Menardi- </b>The official romanization of her name in Japanese is Menadi, 
which is the Italian word for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad">Maenads</a>, otherwise known as Bassarids, Bacchae 
or Bacchantes. They were female worshippers of Dionysus, the Greek god of 
mystery, wine and intoxication, and were known as wild, insane women who could 
not be reasoned with. Dionysus inspired them to go into ecstatic frenzies, which 
involved a lot of violence, bloodbaths, sex, getting drunk, and mutilation. They 
also liked to dance quite a lot too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, that is the secret of the meaning behind Saturos and Menardi. Crazy, 
isn't it? Two people named after crazed sex fiends in an E-rated game! Still, it 
was very clever on Camelot's part to pick these names. I bet few people knew 
about their association with Dionysus and Greek mythology. Of course, I can 
understand why they wouldn't have explained.</p>
<p>It was a little more difficult to find out the meanings behind Agatio's and 
Karst's names, since the connection between the two isn't as obvious and they 
don't come from mythology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Karst</b>- It was hard to find out the meaning behind this name, but 
Wikipedia has an article on &quot;Karst topography&quot;. According to the Karst disambig 
article, Karst is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of layers of soluble 
bedrock characterized by a large number of holes and caves. Yes, it's as boring 
as it sounds so I won't bother going into a lengthy explanation about it. The 
only other results for Karst on Wikipedia were the character herself and the 
last name Karst. There is also a limestone borderline plateau region in Italy 
called Kras, otherwise known as the Classical Karst. Italy again, huh? 
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Agatio- </b>After the oddity of the meaning behind Karst, it wouldn't 
surprise me if this actually came from the word agate. Although agates may be 
found in various kinds of rock, they are classically associated with volcanic 
rocks but can be common in certain metamorphic rocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, after the awesomeness of Saturos and Menardi's names, Agatio and Karst 
are quite a letdown. I mean, <i>rocks</i>? I can understand Agatio's, since 
agate is associated with volcanic rocks, but I don't get Karst at all. </p>
<p>And then there's the only other Proxian to be named, Puelle. His Japanese 
name can be romanized as Pure, so I guess it's to do with purity. It kind of 
makes sense, I guess, since he's nicer than some certain Proxians, but still... 
it's so random.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject of names, there are some other characters in the 
games with names that have some meaning. Conservato, for example, is obviously 
supposed to be a pun on the word &quot;conservative&quot; and we know how much he dislikes 
change. I also believe that Babi comes from &quot;Babel&quot;, considering the 
similarities between the Tower of Babel and Babi Lighthouse. </p>
<p>Susa and Kushinada's names are taken from the legend that the serpent 
storyline is based off. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanoo">Susanoo 
no Mikoto</a> was the Shinto god of the sea and storms. When banished from the 
Heavens, he descended to the province of Izumo where he met an elderly couple. 
Seven of their eight daughters had been eaten by the eight-headed serpent, 
Yamata no Orochi. It was almost time for it to eat their last daughter,&nbsp; 
Kushinada-hime. Susanoo slew the serpent after getting it drunk on sake, then 
found a sword inside its tail, the Kusanagi no Tsurugi. At the time however, it 
was called the Ama-mo-Murakumo no Tsurugi. Murakamo no Tsurugi is in fact the 
Japanese name of the Cloud Brand in the game. Generations later, the A-m-M no 
Tsurugi was given to the warrior Yamato Takeru. Takeru is the name Susa and 
Kushinada (in the game) hope to give to their son.</p>
<p>Kraden's Japanese name, Sclater, may be a reference to the geologist
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sclater">Philip Sclater</a>, who 
developed the theory of a hypothetical land mass he called Lemuria. Way to mess 
that one up, translator people =D</p>
