<p class="auto-style1">History of TAOW</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Has this site 
really been around for so long already?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> What do you know, it 
has. How time flies. It's been a very long time indeed.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Bit by bit, the 
fandom's been crumbling away. Sites disappearing and forums going down...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> And among all the 
destruction, The Adepts of Weyard remains.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> If you wish to know 
about this site's history, then this is the place. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> As well as finding 
out how she became a fan, because you totally wanted to know that, right? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was 2002 A.D. and war was beginning- no, hold on. That's not right.</p>
<p>Ahem. I found out about Golden Sun by hearing about it on a Livejournal 
friend's blog. I ended up buying it and liked it. By the end of 2002, I was 
already writing fanfiction and the Golden Sun fandom was doomed. The fanfic 
section was never really the same again... j/k. I don't know what exactly my 
first fanfic was. Some of my early fanfiction included a high school AU, a diary 
fic and a Lord of the Rings parody where Legolas was played by Donpa. Sadly, I 
am not joking.</p>
<p>It was inevitable I would make a website, really. It started off with the 
"Test Page" in Saturos's Stupid Stuff, and went from there. Ever wondered why my 
images are in a folder called testpage? Yeah, uh, that's why. It really would be 
too much hassle to rename the folder, you know, and who cares anyway. So! I 
ended up making an actual site and lo and behold, the Garet's Kitchen ripoff was 
born! (I'm pretty sure I took the idea of naming sections after Adepts from 
there, haha. Man, Garet's Kitchen was awesome. Thank goodness for Geocities 
archives.)</p>
<p>The Adepts of Weyard was first put up on Tripod. Back then, we used crappy 
free webhosts with like 5 MB of free space and ads everywhere. Especially for 
small hobby sites. It was uploaded around May of 2003.</p>
<p>(BTW, just click on the thumbnails to view larger versions of the images)</p>

<p>I apologize for any blindness or damage to eyes caused by the infernal yellow 
background. The entire website was like that, sadly. Every page sported a 
different combination of background and font colour, many of which probably 
caused eye bleeding in my unfortunate visitors. Apparently, I was immune to bad 
design choices back then... then again, a lot of people were. We're talking the 
past, when Geocities was still around after all. The broken images are because 
it's from the Wayback Machine. It didn't get much of the Tripod version...</p>
<p>The site spent a good while on Tripod, but Tripod had one drawback - forced 
frames on its members' websites. Ugh. Eventually, I had just had enough of 
crappy Tripod and wanted to find a new host. Laronmi, a fellow member of the 
Golden Sun fandom, had just set up a website with hosting available and set me 
up with some webspace, and so TAOW has been on her server ever since.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><a href="oldsite3.png">
<img height="116" src="tn_oldsite3.png" width="200" class="auto-style2" /></a></p>
<p>At some point, I had a nice table on the front page along with a brand new 
blurb. Though I ended up doing away with that when someone pointed out that the 
named sections were pretty confusing, and went with a front page redesign.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><a href="oldsite4.png">
<img height="126" src="tn_oldsite4.png" width="200" class="auto-style2" /></a>
<a href="oldsite5.png">
<img height="103" src="tn_oldsite5.png" width="200" class="auto-style2" /></a></p>
<p>The diabolical yellow background was finally done away with. Hallelujah~</p>
<p>I continued to update the site on a regular basis, adding more content and 
writing fanfiction. I was very prolific with fanfiction indeed. I was an active 
participant in fandom back in the day for sure. Though I ended up taking a break 
from the fandom eventually and updated the site less. Golden Sun 3 was taking a 
very long time to come out and there wasn't really anything new to keep me 
going. So I went and did other things.</p>
<p>And then, in 2009, Golden Sun 3 was finally announced. I rushed to update the 
site with news. Actually, I jumped out of my chair and danced a bit at the news, 
I was so happy. I was so excited that night, I couldn't even sleep. And then we 
ended up not getting any more news for a whole year. Boy, was that an 
excruciating 12 months... and I lost sleep again the night of the following E3.</p>
<p>Eventually, Dark Dawn came out and I started adding new content. At the same 
time, I gave the site a massive overhaul. No more awful page colour 
combinations, yay!</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><a href="oldsite6.png">
<img height="87" src="tn_oldsite6.png" width="200" class="auto-style2" /></a></p>
<p>Dark Dawn stuff was still very much a work in progress. Actually, it still 
is, whoops. Dark Dawn did very little to rejuvenate my interest though I was 
still at least uploading some content... now and then. Occasionally. I actually 
do like Dark Dawn somewhat, despite the fandom's hatred of it, and don't despise 
it the way so many people do. I like the Dark Dawn characters. Most of them 
anyway. </p>
<p>Then, in 2014, the apocalypse happened. I just found myself losing interest 
and was so embarrassed by my humour I threw it all out and hacked the site to 
bits. </p>
<p class="auto-style1"><a href="oldsite7.png">
<img height="91" src="tn_oldsite7.png" width="200" class="auto-style2" /></a><a href="oldsite8.png"><img height="65" src="tn_oldsite8.png" width="200" class="auto-style2" /></a></p>
<p>And that's how The Adepts of Weyard ended up being transformed into a 
soulless husk. Gone was the random humour, insanity and silliness. Now it was 
totally a serious business website with only informational stuff. Boring, right? 
And so I tried to leave it all behind me and move on.</p>
<p>Except then I had regrets. Whoops. Thank goodness for the Wayback Machine. I 
was able to restore most of the removed content, and changed the layout again at 
the same time. As nice a layout as it was, light text on dark backgrounds just 
doesn't work for everybody. Even I found it hard on the eyes at times, so it had 
to change.</p>
<p>And so, in late 2015, TAOW returned to being a site 
full of random fun and nonsense. Yay~!</p>
<p>And now, we wait and see what the future will bring while I continue to add 
more random stuff to the site...</p>
<p>In 2023, the site has gone under another overhaul. Having multiple categories 
for Adepts just kinda stopped being feasible when they released another game 
too... and if they ever released Golden Sun 4, it would be even more chaotic. 
I'm just not as capable of creating humorous content as I used to be either so a 
lot of sections were just sitting empty and unfinished.</p>
<p>So now it's all been brought together, with some content culled, and if 
Golden Sun 4 ever comes out, it will be much easier to integrate it.</p>
<p>So, the focus is on a more organished site, primarily an informational one, 
with the fluff and humour put aside in its own section.</p>
