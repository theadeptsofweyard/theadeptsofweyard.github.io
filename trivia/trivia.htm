<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Ready for 
some random trivia?<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
Here's all the miscellaneous trivia that didn't have any other place to go.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Man, can you imagine how 
different things could have been if we'd smacked down Saturos and Menardi...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> And then the elemental 
stars might never have been taken, and the world would have shrunk...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Uh. Right. Yeah.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Gosh, Felix, you don't 
have to be such a downer.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Well, he is kind of 
right... <br><img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> As difficult 
as some things might have been, in the end, this was our destiny, wasn't it?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> That's right. Fate led us 
down these paths... </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u>Mind Read Antics</u></p>
<p align="left">Okay, so there is a page for Mind Read in Prox. But, Prox isn't 
the only place with normally inaccessible minds to be read. At Jupiter 
Lighthouse, upon the aerie when you only have Felix and Piers, Karst and Agatio 
are waiting for you to light the beacon. They also have thoughts of their own, 
but without Sheba, it's kind of hard to read them. Whatever were the game 
developers doing? Anyway, here are the screens. They aren't on the Prox Mind 
Read page because, well... it <i>isn't </i>Prox...</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="kamr1.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="kamr2.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="kamr3.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">So Agatio <i>wants </i>us to resist him? I love translators... 
it's almost as bad as the &quot;Is Alex is displaying his remarkable foresight 
again?&quot; line in Champa... what is it with Agatio and bad grammar anyway?</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Defeating Saturos and Menardi three years early</u></p>
<p>Yes, it is possible. With a Gameshark, anyway. Saturos and Menardi have the 
same stats as on Venus Lighthouse's aerie. They didn't get much stronger in 
three years then. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="mysterybattle.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="mysterybattle2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Of course, the game developers don't foresee us cheating and defeating 
Saturos and Menardi so early, so as the battle ends, everything is as if Isaac 
and Garet lose. They just lie there unconscious while Saturos and Menardi skip 
away (they have incredible cliff-hopping skills...)</p>
<p>It's still rather fun to see little Isaac and Garet laying the smackdown 
though...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Dummy Weapons</u></p>
<p>In the Debug Rooms, it's possible to get any item that has been coded into 
the game. This includes items that aren't normally accessible in gameplay for 
some reason, hence they are referred to as dummy weapons. Many people know about 
this, and use it to get two Sol Blades in Golden Sun: The Lost Age by way of 
data transfer. It's quite nifty.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="SolEquip.gif" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="SolStatus.gif" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Don't mind Jenna. This is from the first game... anyway, the Sol Blade. A 
pathetic +138 attack, and it doesn't even unleash. Yippee.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="KusEquip.gif" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="KusStatus.gif" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>The Kusanagi isn't much better. This weapon is known as the Masamune in 
Golden Sun: The Lost Age. Doesn't unleash either.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="MasEquip.gif" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="MasStatus.gif" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>And here we have what was called the Masamune in the first game. Unlike the 
first two weapons, it has a description. Uh... okay. Doesn't unleash. In The 
Lost Age, transferring it replaces it with the Fire Brand.</p>
<p>While on the subject of unacquirable items, Golden Sun: The Lost Age has some 
as well.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="sandals.gif" width="16" height="16"> Ninja Sandals. 
Defense +5, Increases rate of critical hits.<br>
<img border="0" src="Greave.gif" width="16" height="16"> Silver Greave. Defense 
+11, Luck +4.<br>
<img border="0" src="kgreave.gif" width="16" height="16"> Knight's Greave. 
Maximum HP +5.<br>
<img border="0" src="aroma.gif" width="16" height="16"> Aroma Ring. Restores 100 
HP to all allies.<br>
<img border="0" src="rainbow.gif" width="16" height="16"> Rainbow Ring. Deludes 
up to three enemies.<br>
<img border="0" src="Soul.gif" width="16" height="16"> Soul Ring. Revives an 
ally to full health.<br>
<img border="0" src="cashirt.gif" width="16" height="16"> Casual Shirt. Defense 
+3, HP Recovery +5<br>
<img border="0" src="camisole.gif" width="16" height="16"> Divine Camisole. 
Defense +10, Luck +5</p>
<p>There are unacquirable Djinn too. Kind of. With Codebreaker or Gameshark, it 
is possible to code a Djinni in as a Psynergy so you could use it in battle as 
if you'd called on the Djinni itself. Except doing Psynergy instead wouldn't 
weaken your stats and let you summon. Among the Psynergy that can be coded in 
are Venus18, Venus19, Mars18, Mars19, and same for Jupiter and Mercury too. So, 
evidently, there were meant to be 20 of each Djinn. Coding in these extra Djinn 
will do nothing however. They don't do a thing. They don't even have names.</p>
<p>And I'm not even done yet. There is Psynergy coded into the game that you 
can't use in normal gameplay too.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="arrow1.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="arrow2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>One such Psynergy is A??, also known as Arrow.&nbsp; No actual use has been found 
for this Psynergy. It is a Jupiter Elemental Utility Psynergy, costing 2 PP. 
When used on the field, a bow and arrow is summoned, and an arrow is fired. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="aurora1.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="aurora2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Then there is Aurora Field. It doesn't even have an icon for some reason, and 
costs 0 PP. It also has no element. When used in battle, it completely restores 
the HP of all battling Adepts, even those who have fallen in battle. Unlike 
Iris, it only works on the ones in the front party. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="magnet1.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="magnet2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Ma????, otherwise known as Magnet, is another strange utility Psynergy, not 
used in battle. Has an icon and 1 PP, and is Venus Elemental. When used. a shiny 
circle appears around Felix for about ten seconds and that's it. It doesn't seem 
to have any use, just like Arrow.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="reflect1.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="reflect2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>We also have Reflect, a battle Psynergy of the Mercury Element which costs 
5 PP. It can only be cast on one Adept at a time, but doesn't seem to do 
anything. Some Psynergy will flow into the chosen Adept and they glow for a 
brief second, similar to someone being healed or revived, and then they feel the 
effects of it. Whatever the effects are. It actually doesn't do anything. 
Judging by the icon, perhaps it was meant to be some kind of barrier Psynergy 
but that's just a guess.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="regenerate1.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="regenerate2.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="regenerate3.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Then we have Regenerate. It is a battle Psynergy, of the Mercury Element and 
costs 6PP. When used, it appears similar to the Wish Psynergy and it affects 
just one Adept. When used, it will damage whoever it was used on. However, it 
will then start healing the Adept it hurt for four turns.</p>
<p><img src="charm1.png" width="240" height="160"><img src="charm2.png" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Goodness, there's no end to this. Next is Charm, a battle Psynergy of the 
Jupiter element costing 6PP.&nbsp; When used in battle, the game will either 
tell you the opponent's heart was stolen or that it failed. However, the 
&quot;charmed&quot; opponent will not act any differently. After a few turns, the game 
will report the opponent has regained consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="confuse1.png" width="240" height="160"><img src="confuse2.png" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>And now we have Confuse, a battle Psynergy of the Jupiter element costing 
6PP. It has a chance of &quot;confusing&quot; the opponent. However, the &quot;confused&quot; 
opponent won't act differently at all. </p>
<p><img src="paralyze.png" width="240" height="160"><img src="paralyze2.png" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Next is Paralyze, a Jupiter elemental battle Psynergy costing 7PP. When 
casting it in battle, it has a chance of stunning the opponent. When it does 
work, the opponent will be afflicted with the &quot;Stun&quot; status condition.</p>
<p><img src="taint1.png" width="240" height="160"><img src="taint2.png" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Taint is a Venus elemental battle Psynergy that costs 4PP. Using it in battle 
will cause the opponent to become poisoned.</p>
<p><img src="poison1.png" width="240" height="160"><img src="poison2.png" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Poison is a Venus elemental battle Psynergy costing 6PP and using it in 
battle will inflict the Venom status on an opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's all the inaccessible stuff I can find. Whew... that was 
exhaustive. =/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Return to Vale in TLA</u></p>
<p>Hate Kraden for saying you can't go back to Vale in The Lost Age? Well, there 
is a handy dandy solution for it. Screw him. Most people know about this 
already, but for those who don't... (how can anyone not know?!)</p>
<p>Firstly, you need the wings for your ship. There is a little beach south of 
Loho, which you must fly onto and then try to hop off below the mountain. 
Wriggle the ship around a bit and you should make it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="beach.PNG" width="240" height="160"><img border="0" src="beach2.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>We're in the old world now. Altmiller Cave should be here, but it's not. Most 
towns as well as entrances to caves/dungeons in the 'old' Weyard don't show up, 
so the area you can access is fairly limited.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="karagol.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Remember the Karagol Sea? This is it. You should know the way to Vale from 
here. I'm not explaining that... and the Kalay docks don't block the way 
anymore, so go ahead in the direction of Vale.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="vale.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>Sadly, you can't enter Vale. But it's quite fun to have Felix stomp over 
it... for a few seconds. &quot;Rah! I'm Godzilla! *stomp* *smash*&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="imil.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p>You can't get here normally. I used the Walk on Map code to get here, but 
hey, Imil's sprite is on the map. I always suspected you could see a few pixels 
of it in a split second during the ending of TLA (when Mercury's beacon fires 
toward Vale) I guess I was right. And, no, you can't enter Imil. Strangely 
enough, while Babi Lighthouse is visible on the map, you don't see Lalivero (and 
it's painfully clear in the ending) ... I don't get how game developers' minds 
work at all...</p>
<p><u>Yepp's Song</u></p>
<p>The tune to Yepp's song is actually the same as the tune to a song from 
Japanese children game, though the lyrics are not the same. The song is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagome_Kagome">Kagome, Kagome</a> and if 
you watch this
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQNPAcV8AnI&feature=related">video</a> 
of it and listen to the tune that goes with Yepp's Song, you'll notice that the 
tunes are very similar.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Unused Dialogue</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><img height="422" src="script.png" width="528"></p>
<p>There is dummed out dialogue located in the code for the first game, which 
can be accessed through the script editor in Atrius's Golden Sun hacking 
program. The dialogue is supposed to take place during the prologue.</p>
<p>The dialogue goes as follows:</p>
<p>Theoretical NPC #1 : Do you know what became of the boulder that fell from 
Mt. Aleph? </p>
<p>[Yes/No] (It's not clearly stated as such, but I'm pretty sure it's a yes/no 
question)</p>
<p>Yes? - What? It's falling toward the village? The elders are holding it 
back?!? They are the most powerful Psynergy Adepts in Vale. </p>
<p>No? - They said the Boulder would have to fall sometime... I just knew a 
storm like this would knock it loose! </p>
<p>Theoretical NPC #2: Jenna asked me to help Felix. If I didn't have to use 
Psynergy, I'd help in an instant! </p>
<p>I've tried different things with the prologue, but the dialogue never shows 
up, so it seems to be inaccessible. My theory is that it belongs to that old 
couple in the plaza, who both react as if you're asking them to help. Maybe the 
above dialogue is what they were supposed to say instead if, for example, you 
refused to help Felix when Dora asked you earlier, but the flag doesn't trigger. 
It's just a theory though. Maybe they belonged to NPCs who were removed later 
on.</p>
