Here's another useful page of information.<br />

Game codes, huh? That sure is useful.<br />
<img height="32" src="file:///D:/OneDrive/Websites/The%20Adepts%20of%20Weyard/icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> 
Yeah. Remembering all those button combinations can be tricky.<br />

The webmistress is updating a lot lately.<br />
<img height="32" src="file:///D:/OneDrive/Websites/The%20Adepts%20of%20Weyard/icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> 
Well, you know, waiting for more information on the third game is really boring.<br />
<img height="32" src="file:///D:/OneDrive/Websites/The%20Adepts%20of%20Weyard/icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> 
Yeah, it sure is...</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Naming Extra Characters</p>
<p class="style3">At the naming screen, hit select three times. In Golden Sun, 
this will let you name Garet, Ivan and Mia, while in Golden Sun: The Lost Age, 
it is used to rename Jenna, Sheba and Piers. </p>
<p class="style3">When you are naming Mia or Piers, depending on your game, 
press: <strong>Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Right, Down, 
Left, Up, Select</strong>.</p>
<p class="style3">If done properly, you will be able to name Felix, Jenna and 
Sheba in Golden Sun or Isaac, Garet, Ivan and Mia in TLA.</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Return to Last Sanctum</p>
<p class="style3">At the loading screen, select the file where you wish to 
return your party to the last sanctum you visited. Hold L and Start, then press 
A.</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Soft Resetting</p>
<p class="style3">You can &quot;hard reset&quot; by turning the handheld on and off, but 
there&#39;s an even quicker way to restart the game. Simply hold A, B, Start and 
Select.</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Send Option</p>
<p class="style3">Only in the first game. When you have completed the game and 
have a &quot;Clear Data&quot; file, then you can use the Send option. To unlock it, at the 
menu screen, hold the R button and Left on the D-Pad, then press Start. A new 
&quot;Send&quot; option will then appear.</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Sound Test</p>
<p class="style3">The Lost Age only. In battle mode, there is a lady to the left 
of the room (she accuses you of not working out much) However, if you hold the R 
button when you speak to her, she will say something different and then allow 
you to listen to various tracks from the games. If you load battle mode using 
Clear Data, then you will be able to listen to a complete track, as certain 
tracks will be unavailable without the Clear Data,</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Difficulty Modes</p>
<p class="style3">After beating the game once and saving the Clear Data, you can 
then start a new game and this time you will have the option of choosing Easy 
Mode or Hard Mode. Easy Mode will transfer the levels, EXP and stat changes of 
the party in the Clear Data to the new file, as well as their money. Hard Mode, 
however, will not carry anything over from the Clear Data and the enemies in 
Hard Mode are much stronger.</p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Battle Themes</p>
<p class="style3">After Isaac&#39;s party has joined you, it is possible to change 
the music you hear when battling. If you have Felix in your party, you will hear 
the regular battle theme. However, if Felix is not in the party and Isaac is, 
then you will hear the battle music from the first game instead. If neither 
Felix nor Isaac are in the party and Jenna is, you will hear her battle theme 
which was originally heard in the prologue. Taking all three of them out will 
keep the regular battle theme.</p>
