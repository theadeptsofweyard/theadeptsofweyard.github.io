<p><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Ooh, just 
thinking about ovens make me hungry.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Who doesn't like 
looking in ovens?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I wonder what 
people think about us wandering into their houses and peeking in their ovens...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Not to mention 
raiding their pots and barrels and even their beds...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> We're just a 
regular bunch of kleptomaniacs...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Of course we don't 
steal their food though. I think. Do stat boosting items count?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> So, here's a handy 
dandy list of oven descriptions from all over Weyard for you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Some oven 
descriptions are not available through normal gameplay. What the heck is up with 
that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Bilibin's ovens are 
blocked off by NPCs. One can be interacted with using walk through codes, but 
not the other.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> The oven 
descriptions however can be found in text dumps. There are two ovens that give 
you items, and then tell you it is pitch dark inside when you examine them, in 
Imil and Suhalla.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> There are, however, 
oven descriptions located in the text that perfectly correspond to Imil and 
Suhalla. Honestly, it's all very strange indeed. Anyway, these inaccessible oven 
messages are now included on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Lunpa</strong></p>
<p>He&#39;s making Thieves&#39; Stew... It has a very distinct scent.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s making Thieves&#39; Cookies. They&#39;re in the shape of... Dodonpa&#39;s face?</p>
<p><strong>Bilibin</strong></p>
<p>Fresh Omelettes! Bilibino [sic] omelettes use Wild Mushrooms caught in the 
area.</p>
<p>Looks like egg soup. Soft eggs are key to its flavor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Imil</strong><br />
<br />
It looks like porridge. This is the best thing when you&#39;re sick!</p>
<p>It's some hot stew. It warms the body and the soul.</p>
<p><strong>Xian</strong></p>
<p>Isaac and his friends are shocked! They&#39;ve never seen ingredients like that!<br />
<br />
They&#39;re making stir-fry. The cabbage looks strangely appetizing.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s the Xian Gourmet, the best in the world! It looks so appetizing, it&#39;s hard 
to imagine how good it tastes.<br />
<br />
They&#39;re steamed dumplings. They&#39;re great piping hot!</p>
<p><strong>Altin</strong></p>
<p>He is making roast beef. Even the peppers look appetizing!<br />
<br />
He is making shrimp in a chili sauce. The shrimp looks so scrumptious... My 
mouth is watering.<br />
<br />
The pots and pans are rusted...</p>
<p><strong>Kalay</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s a Kalay Salad with cucumber and yogurt. I can&#39;t imagine what it tastes 
like!<br />
<br />
He&#39;s making curry. Its spicy scent makes the mouth water.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s pickles with garlic. The pickle is popular in Kalay, but no one knows 
why...<br />
<br />
She&#39;s toasting some bread. It smells great.</p>
<p><strong>Tolbi</strong></p>
<p>He is boiling the pasta. It looks like he&#39;s overcooking it!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s Tolbi seafood pasta! With lots of olive oil and basil!<br />
<br />
She&#39;s making the world-renowned Tolbi pizza. The scent of cheese... Oh, no! 
Something is burning!</p>
<p><strong>Suhalla</strong></p>
<p>He&#39;s making mulukhiya soup. It tastes great, and it&#39;s good for your body.</p>
<p>It's a cactus steak! ...I wonder if it tastes good.</p>
<p><strong>Lalivero</strong></p>
<p>She&#39;s making roast chicken. This scent... It must be flavoured with garlic.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s rice made with grains from the area. It looks so fluffy. It will go with 
any food!<br />
<br />
She&#39;s making mushroom soup. In Lalivero, they toss in all kinds of local beans 
and herbs.<br />
<br />
She&#39;s frying freshwater fish from the river. The fish is fried crispy. You could 
even eat the bones!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a Lalivero Salad with potato and cactus. It looks good, but a little 
spiky... Mmm... Spiky.<br />
<br />
The pot is full of a stew made with many ingredients. It looks like it will 
bring strength.</p>
<p><strong>Madra</strong></p>
<p>A pot of Masala tea is boiling on the stove. It&#39;s full of milk, and it has a 
nice, sweet smell. It&#39;s driving me crazy!<br />
<br />
All the spices are neatly arranged. No dining table in Madra would be complete 
without them.<br />
<br />
They&#39;re making nan (naan). It looks weird, though... I guess in Madra, they add 
nuts and raisins.<br />
<br />
There are some potatoes boiling in the pot. Maybe they&#39;re making potato salad.<br />
<br />
They&#39;re making tandoori chicken. In Madra, it&#39;s cooked on the bone. It&#39;s one of 
the dishes they&#39;re famous for.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a chicken curry slowly simmering on the stove. Judging from the smell 
and the deep red colour, it must have a lot of tomatoes in it.</p>
<p><strong>Alhafra</strong></p>
<p>There is a seafood pie baking in the oven. Its reputation for having a, er, 
fragrant smell precedes it.<br />
<br />
Seasonal veggies boiling with some lamb meat. The oyster seasoning is really 
tempting my tummy.<br />
<br />
It looks like some kind of seafood soup. It smells like the ocean!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s Alhafra&#39;s famous broiled lobster! It&#39;s bigger than I could ever possibly 
have imagined!</p>
<p>That seafood stew has an abundant variety of fish. One bite of that, and I'd 
be hooked!</p>
<p><strong>Mikasalla</strong></p>
<p>That cheese looks fabulous. I could really use a snack... Maybe with some 
bread and- Gah! I&#39;m getting hungry!<br />
<br />
Fresh eggs, over easy... Some people call &#39;em &quot;sunny side up&quot;! When it comes to 
breakfast, these are the best!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a roast chicken so big it&#39;s practically bursting out of the oven! Hmm... I 
wonder if it was related to the chicken I saw outside... I thought it was a pet!</p>
<p><strong>Garoh</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of strange-looking plants boiling in that large pot. It&#39;s got 
a familiar smell I just can&#39;t quite put my finger on.<br />
<br />
Eeeeew! They&#39;re frying up bug larvae!! It looks awful! But it smells GREAT!<br />
<br />
Huh, what is that!? Lobster grilled in the shell! I&#39;d like to experience this 
luxurious culinary treat at least once in my life!<br />
<br />
Newts skewered over and open flame. Are they making food or some strange kind of 
medicine?<br />
<br />
It&#39;s lamb on the bone, broiled over an open flame. The lamb is golden brown and 
juicy. They&#39;d probably notice if I took some... Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>E. Tundaria Islet</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s fish I&#39;ve never seen before gently simmering there. I wonder what 
this foul soup could possibly taste like... I&#39;m not sure I want to find out.</p>
<p><strong>Contigo</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s a bright-red soup full of beans and tomatoes simmering. That spicy 
smell is really something else, but it might burn my mouth a bit.<br />
<br />
Contigo&#39;s famous for these cookies they make... I&#39;ve heard that, even if you 
have the recipe, it still takes years to learn to bake them.<br />
<br />
Ah, the smell of fresh corn bread cooking in the oven! One whiff, and I&#39;m 
drooling like a bulldog!</p>
<p><strong>Shaman Village</strong></p>
<p>That simmering soup is made with broth of cow bones. It seems it&#39;s a 
traditional Shaman meal, passed down from generation to generation.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve never seen vegetables like the ones boiling there. Whoa! They really stink! 
Do people actually eat those!?</p>
<p><strong>Kalt Island</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s Kaltic stew made with lamb meat and potatoes. Looks pretty tasty, if 
you like boiled meat.<br />
<br />
<strong>Prox</strong></p>
<p>Those boiling vegetables look like weeds. I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t be eating 
any of those anytime soon.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s cheese in this stew. Hey! There&#39;s mold growing on it! Is it supposed to 
be like that?<br />
<br />
They&#39;ve got some strange meat I&#39;ve never seen before. Instead of firewood, 
they&#39;re cooking it with burning antlers. I wonder if the meat and the antlers 
came from the same animal.</p>
