On the next episode of showing off hidden content in the Golden Sun games... we 
have the scene where Felix and company meet up with Piers in Kibombo. Of course, 
you have to have seen Piers in jail. This is very important, as the Madran 
mayor's wife will then give you access to Osenia, where you can kick Briggs's 
butt and prove Piers's innocence. Then Piers will be released from jail. Yay!</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
For reference's sake, here is the dialogue when you meet Piers.<br />
</p>

Piers: Wh-Who are you?!? What... What are your intentions? <br />
Sheba: It looks like Piers has already forgotten us, huh? <br />
(Yes) Jenna: I know! We met Piers when he was in JAIL! And it's not like he had 
lots of visitors, either! <br />
(No) Jenna: What, is he so obsessed with his black orb that he can't even 
remember us? <br />
Piers: Wait a second... I know you... You're the travelers who came seeking me 
when I was in jail. <br />
Kraden: So, you DO remember! <br />
Piers: What are you doing in this place? <br />
Sheba: Actually, that's what we wanted to ask you... <br />
Jenna: We were worried about you, Piers, so we followed you here... <br />
Piers: And that's what brings you to this dangerous place? <br />
Sheba: What's that supposed to mean? <br />
Jenna: We came here to help you, Piers. Why are you being like that about it?
<br />
Piers: Tell me something... Exactly when did I ask you for your help? <br />
Akafubu: SILENCE! I shall now present our jewel to the Great Gabomba!

<p>Now, unknown to anyone who hasn't already seen it on Golden Sun Universe (no, 
I didn't actually make this discovery myself, I'm sorry to say, but I'm making a 
page for it anyway because why not, it's kinda interesting) there's actually a 
different set of dialogue for meeting Piers in Kibombo.</p>
<p>In order to get this dialogue, you have to not have seen Piers in jail. Even 
though you can't get to Osenia otherwise. Okay. I've even made screenshots... 
because I felt like it.</p>

<br />

<p>As you can see, the conversation is rather different. Gotta say, I love 
Piers's somewhat snarky line about looking for a boat in the middle of the 
continent. </p>
<p>So, what does this mean? I guess, at one point, the developers were going to 
make seeing Piers in jail optional. It does sound like they already know he at 
least has a boat though. </p>
<p>Yeah, that's pretty much it.</p>
