<p class="auto-style1"><img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
Yet another informational page coming up for you all.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Possibly a relic of 
when the two games might have been one.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Hmm, that would have 
been quite something, wouldn't it.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> It seems Felix and 
Sheba can be added as playable characters.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> There's also PC07, who 
doesn't get mentioned here.<br>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> And evidence suggests 
that may once have been me... check the mystery of me page for more details.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack1.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Well, we have Felix, Jenna and Sheba here (Mia's there for no 
particular reason whatsoever.) Oh? Felix and Sheba don't have any HP or PP!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack2.PNG" width="240" height="160">
<img border="0" src="hack3.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Felix and Sheba have no stats. Also, notice how Sheba has a 
sprite in the top left part of the screen, but Felix doesn't? Interesting... 
and, their classes are NPC. They have no Psynergy either.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack4.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Jenna is of course the same as when she left the party in Sol 
Sanctum.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack5.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Well, the lack of stats won't do! It's off to the Debug Room to 
get items from the pink statue (Hard Nuts, Cookies, etc. will do) The cat above 
will nicely raise their levels as well. That man does nothing though.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack6.PNG" width="240" height="160">
<img border="0" src="hack7.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Stat boosting items and levelling up is the way to make Felix 
and Sheba actually playable. With 0 Max HP, they can't really be revived after 
all.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack8.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Mia, Jenna, Sheba and the Invisible Venus Adept prepare to 
return to the last sanctum... (Don't ask about the Djinn...)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack9.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Back in Kolima. Now the nice old guy up there will revive Felix 
and Sheba for me.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack10.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Now they are alive! Let's go and have fun now.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack11.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Jenna really never learns anything other than the Flare series 
by the way, so you're not missing out on anything by having her kidnapped. I 
suggest simply playing The Lost Age where she has better Psynergy...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack12.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Felix and Sheba still don't have Psynergy. But that can be 
changed...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack13.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">With the Venus Djinni from Kolima, Granite. (Yes, I skipped 
Flint while having fun messing with my savefile. Can't stand the forced 
demonstration. No idea why Breeze is there.)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack14.PNG" width="240" height="160">
<img border="0" src="hack15.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">ZOMGWTFBBQ, Felix's class and Psynergy is coded into GS1! *le 
gasp* ... Not, because the same thing happens with Sheba, so never mind... Sheba 
as a squire is certainly strange. I guess they are simply being given Isaac's 
base class because of the Venus Djinni being put on them.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack16.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Even if you put Granite on standby, Felix will remain a Squire 
and not return to NPC status. Same with Sheba.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack17.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Battle time! For some reason, Felix has got Isaac's sprite, 
which I assume happened because of messing with the Djinni and class. (At this 
point, I haven't actually set the Venus Djinni on Sheba.) Sheba appears as a 
Vermin.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack18.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Felix and Sheba have Isaac's face portrait in battle for some 
reason...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack19.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Let's put Fever on Felix! (I made a very quick detour to Imil) 
He will become a Brute if I set Fever to him, much like Isaac would.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack20.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Also trying Sheba with a Jupiter Djinni set on her. She will go 
from NPC to Apprentice. Different Djinn will have different effects, it seems. 
Anyway, Apprentice class... that's interesting... Isaac will become an 
Apprentice if you put one Jupiter Djinni on him (with only Venus Djinn on him as 
well, either set or standby. It doesn't matter.)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack21.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">Screwing with Sheba's class has also turned her into Isaac. Now 
Jenna and Mia have two Isaacs to choose from...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="hack22.PNG" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p align="left">So long as you're not messing with classes and Djinn, Felix and 
Sheba's default battle sprite will be the Vermin. Why Vermin? I really have no 
clue.</p>
