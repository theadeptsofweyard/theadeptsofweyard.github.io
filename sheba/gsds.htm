<p align="left">On Tuesday, the 2nd of June 2009, a monumental occasion that 
many of us had been excitedly awaiting and anticipating for many, many years 
finally came to pass. A new Golden Sun game was at long last announced for the 
Nintendo DS. A trailer was released with gameplay footage and at long last, we 
knew we had the game that we had spent almost a decade waiting for.</p>
<p align="left">Maybe not <i>almost</i>, but it sure felt like it! Golden Sun: 
The Lost Age was released outside of Japan in 2003, and we've waited <b>six 
years</b> for word from Camelot on a new game. Now we have it at long last.</p>
<p align="left">Currently, we just have the information from the playable demo 
shown at E3, but as more information 
comes out, you can bet this page will be regularly updated with new and up to 
date information!</p>
<p align="left">The Nintendo E3 
Press Kit yielded some goodies, 
including the trailer and a piece of official art.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2oRjZSDCQo">Watch the 
trailer on Youtube</a></p>

<p align="left">Be sure to look closely, because they definitely are not Isaac, 
Garet and Mia. ;)</p>
<p align="left">Another interesting tidbit of information has popped up on the Nintendo E3 Press Release 
page.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;<strong><em>Golden Sun</em>� <em>DS</em>: </strong>After going 
dark six years ago, 2010 will see a new dawn. <em>Golden Sun DS </em>updates the 
popular portable <em>Golden Sun </em>role-playing series with an impressive 
graphical style. This installment follows the story of the previous heroes� 
descendants and immerses players into the magic of its adventure by pushing the 
boundaries of intuitive touch-screen controls. <em>Golden Sun DS </em>is 
playable on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi systems.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">So, in a nutshell, that means Golden Sun DS will involve playing 
as the descendants of Isaac and co. Oh yeah, bring on the shipping wank. ^_^</p>
<p align="left">Youtube has two gameplay videos up, by
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgFWBf34MFs">Gamekyo</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNYGt8gRQo">RPGamer</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Gamekyo also posted a couple of pictures of the game's prologue, 
including <a href="http://www.gamekyo.com/images33_4_31241.html">this one</a>. 
The other one is sadly impossible to read as it's so small. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>15th June 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">We got an E3 update! The trailer has just been shown at E3 and 
I'll post links and such when it's up!</p>
<p align="left">The title is Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, and it is going to be 
released &quot;this holiday&quot;. Yeah.</p>
<p align="left">The characters have names now. Isaac lookalike is Matthew, the 
girl is Karis and the Garet lookalike is Tyrell.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JhqdFxOyqc">Trailer now 
up on Youtube</a></p>
<p align="left">A picture has shown up on IGN, showing a fourth name alongside 
Karis, Matthew and Tyrell.</p>

<p align="left">Could Crown be the fourth playable character? Perhaps so. (Also, 
look through the other screenshots on that site while you're there. Plenty of 
new stuff.)</p>
<p align="left">And now we have another screenshot, depicting whom I believe are 
Isaac and Garet fighting alongside Matthew and Karis.</p>

Man, I'm beginning to get tired of updating this page @.@ Anyway, the press 
release is up (I'd link to it but it would go down later anyway...) Here are the 
facts from the press release.</p>
<p align="left">
&quot;<b>It�s Always Darkest Before the Dawn</b><br>
A classic role-playing game branches out with a new look, countless<br>
adventures and heroic battles. The game picks up 30 years after the first two<br>
games in the series left off. At the end of Golden Sun: The Lost Age, the<br>
heroes succeeded in bringing the world-healing power of the Golden Sun back<br>
to the world of Weyard. In the years since, the immense power of the Golden<br>
Sun has changed nearly everything. Continents have shifted. New countries<br>
have emerged. New species have appeared. But the world is now imperiled by<br>
a new threat. Psynergy Vortexes, which suck the elemental Psynergy from<br>
both the land and power-wielding Adepts alike, are spreading across the world.<br>
The new generation of heroes � the children of those from the previous games<br>
� are drawn into the mystery behind the vortexes, as they cross a chaotic world<br>
that is succumbing to a new evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<b>FEATURES</b>:<br>
� Amazing graphics and beautifully animated summoning abilities that span both<br>
Nintendo DS screens let players experience the game like never before.<br>
� The story takes place 30 years after the final events of the second game, when 
the<br>
Golden Sun Effect occurred. The main characters are the descendents of the<br>
previous game�s heroes.<br>
� Intuitive touch-screen control has been implemented throughout the game, 
controlling<br>
character movements and the release of Psynergy � magical abilities with 
powerful<br>
effects over people and the environment. Touch control also streamlines battle<br>
commands and gives players a stronger tactile connection to the action on the<br>
screen.<br>
� Players will explore a vast and beautifully rendered world where they will 
find many<br>
treasures, encounter dangerous creatures and manipulate objects blocking their<br>
path. Players will also hunt for and collect Djinn, mysterious elemental 
creatures used<br>
to summon powerful spirits in battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Will have logo up soon.</p>
<p align="left">Gameplay videos of the playable demo are now available for 
viewing. From these videos, we can see that Terrell's name is now Tyrell.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>21st July 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">Some new information has been released periodically in the form 
of Japanese magazines. There's nothing major in the way of information though, 
just a few tidbits.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="jump.jpg">Jump Article</a></p>
<p align="left">Famitsu Article <a href="famitsu1.jpg">Page 1</a>
<a href="famitsu2.jpg">Page 2</a></p>
<p align="left">Jump tells us that Matthew is an Earth Adept and a trained 
warrior, Tyrell is a mischievous Fire Adept and Matthew's best friend and Karis 
is a Wind Adept who is reliable and strong-willed.</p>
<p align="left">Famitsu revealed that Dark Dawn will only be one game, however 
we'll be allowed to imagine what the world will be like after the game is over. 
Matthew is 16 years old and it is said that he lives with his father (Nintendo 
Dream has revealed he also lives with his grandfather, Kyle), implying 
he has no mother. Tyrell is said to be living with Matthew too (I suppose Garet 
is living with them as well. We do see him in that screenshot.) Karis is the 
childhood friend of Matthew and Tyrell and visits them a lot. </p>
<p align="left">The unleash of Alchemy caused natural disasters to affect Weyard 
and the continents are no longer the same. The land is healing from the wounds 
created by the Golden Sun and the catacombs of ancient civilisations will be the 
setting for the adventures of Dark Dawn's protagonists. The heroes of the 
previous games are scorned by some because of the damage caused by unleashing 
Alchemy and their children have to shoulder this burden. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>5th August 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">There are a couple of new scans from Shonen Jump magazine. No 
real new information, but the scans are at least worth taking a look at.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/1464/gsds31.jpg">Page 1</a>
<a href="http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/4691/gsds32.jpg">Page 2</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong>18th August 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">A new Japanese trailer has appeared, and it features the first 
actual appearance of Crown, who is a girl.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZiA2CbIwQ">
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZiA2CbIwQ</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong>23rd August 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">New scans have emerged from V-Jump magazine.</p>
<p align="left">
<a href="http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/6334/vjump220810.jpg">Page 1</a>
<a href="http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/2933/vjump2208102.jpg">Page 2</a></p>
<p align="left">Again, not much we don't already know. Tyrell is confirmed to be 
Garet's son. Karis is said to be an ambitious and aggressive girl. Nothing is 
said about her parentage. </p>
<p align="left">On the Psynergy vortexes: The world is successfully rebuilt, but 
Psynergy Vortexes start appearing all over the world. The vortex we see is not 
actually the vortex itself but rather the vaporized Psynergy power covering the 
thing. The article then questions what's inside the vortex itself. Commentary on 
the screenshots says that Tyrell is too confident, he gets too close to the 
vortex and ends up fainting because of his Psynergy being absorbed. Matthew 
wants to save Tyrell, so he casts Psynergy, but it just gets absorbed. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>30th August 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">We have a release date at long last! \o/</p>
<p align="left">&quot;NINTENDO'S GOLDEN SUN: DARK DAWN LAUNCHING ON NOV. 29<br>
<br>
August 30, 2010<br>
<br>
The dawn of a new entry in the renowned Golden Sun� video game series has nearly 
arrived in North America. Nintendo has announced that Golden Sun: Dark Dawn for 
the top-selling Nintendo DS� family of portable game systems will launch on Nov. 
29.<br>
<br>
Offering a planet-sized world of adventure to explore and conquer, Golden Sun: 
Dark Dawn puts the raw power of the elements in players' hands. Each of the 
game's playable characters is capable of carrying Djinn, spirits that imbue 
their owner with unique and powerful abilities. Players can collect more than 70 
unique Djinn, granting them the ability to summon mighty deities who unleash 
devastating attacks that fill both Nintendo DS screens. Djinn powers can also be 
used to navigate puzzling dungeons and overworld environments that will have 
players flinging fireballs to burn away obstacles, freezing water to raise 
platforms, or summoning whirlwinds to create bridges out of floating objects.<br>
<br>
Taking place 30 years after the events of Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost 
Age for the Game Boy� Advance system, Golden Sun: Dark Dawn introduces a new 
generation of heroes that are struggling to survive in a radically changed 
world. What begins as a simple journey to rescue a lost friend turns into a 
dramatic quest to save the land from catastrophe as players are drawn into a 
world full of magical energy.&quot;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>3rd September 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left"><a href="menu.jpg">A new picture</a> of Crown has emerged in the 
form of her face portrait. No official art yet.</p>
<p align="left">If you look at the picture closely, it looks like there's 
somebody beneath her, so perhaps we're getting more characters? ^_^</p>
<p align="left"><strong>4th September 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">
<a href="http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5534/goldensundarkdawnscanju.jpg">
New scan</a> from Jump.</p>
<p align="left">Official art of Crown is revealed (plus new art of Matt and co). 
I've actually been thinking Crown might be a boy after all because of the menu 
art, but the official art hasn't cleared it up really because Crown would 
obviously be too young to have boobs &gt;.&gt; (Unless you're Ken Sugimori...)</p>
<p align="left">As we know, Crown is a Mercury Adept. He is also a very 
knowledgeable researcher travelling around the world and investigating, seeking 
rich knowledge, and he travels with a teacher of alchemic scholars. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>9th September 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">New

<p align="left">At 1:44, it shows a new playable character named Halmarny using 
a Mercury Psynergy.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>17th September 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">The Japanese
<a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/bo5j/index.html">Dark Dawn site</a> has 
had a revamp. The Character section shows the silhouette of a new character, who 
will be &quot;coming soon&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">Alchemy - the science of the four elements that make up 
everything in the world. Long ago, Alchemy was sealed away, because its powers 
could destroy the world. Because the elements were the source of all energy, 
Weyard began drifting toward destruction. The Golden Sun freed the elements and 
saved the world. At the same time, it unleashed a disastrous power and a great 
price was paid. 30 years have passed since that time...</p>
<p align="left">The Golden Sun - 30 years ago, when the warriors of Vale broke 
the seal of Alchemy, a powerful energy shone on Mt. Aleph. This phenomenon came 
to be known as the Golden Sun. It saved the world at a great price - the 
released energy caused natural disasters to occur all over the world, due to the 
boom in activity throughout creation.</p>
<p align="left">Warriors from Vale - The warriors who broke the seal on Alchemy 
30 years ago and saved the world. Four of them came from Vale, hence the name 
&quot;Warriors of Vale&quot;. Some revere them as the heroes who saved the world, while 
others believe they are to blame for the natural disasters that came after the 
Golden Sun.</p>
<p align="left">Psynergy/Adepts - Psynergy is a mental power based on Alchemy. 
Using the four elements, Psynergy can do various things and have varied effects. 
The four types are Earth, Fire, Wind and Water, and those who wield it are known 
as Adepts. These Adepts have inherited the blood of the ancient tribes who 
disappeared along with their civilizations.</p>
<p align="left">Djinn - Djinn are the elements, in physical forms, and appear 
similar to animals. They enhance the strength of Adepts when close to then and 
can let them summon powerful spirits.</p>
<p align="left">Weyard - The world that Matthew and friends live in, it is built 
upon the four elements and many different species can be found there. The Golden 
Sun caused disasters to happen all over the world and the damage that was caused 
is still visible. However, as its lost power has been revive, Weyard is growing 
and advancing at a great rate.</p>
<p align="left">Matthew - Son of one of the heroes who saved the world and 
protagonist of the story, an Earth Adept. He looks up to his father, the leader 
of the warriors of Vale. He bears a great resemblance to his father and, like 
him, doesn't talk much, but he is strong willed nonetheless.</p>
<p align="left">Karis - A determined girl with a sharp mind who is a Wind Adept. 
She is a childhood friend of Matthew and Terry and often comes to visit. She is 
determined and strong willed.</p>
<p align="left">Tyrell - The mischievous yet good-willed best friend of Matthew, 
a Fire Adept. He loves to play pranks and this often gets into trouble. The 
adventure starts with a situation that he has caused.</p>
<p align="left">Crown - A curious researcher of Alchemy and a Water Adept. He 
studies underneath a master of Alchemy and travels all over the world, visiting 
various towns. Because he enjoys research and is naturally curious, he is always 
looking out for details.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>30th September 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">A
<a href="http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/853/wwwdotuporg1174069.jpg">new 
magazine scan</a> (Jump magazine) is out.</p>
<p align="left">Another playable character is revealed - a Mars Adept, who is 
also a familiar face. In fact, he is none other than Eoleo! Eoleo is the prince 
of the pirate kingdom of Champa and the pirates' leader. He is free, wild and 
has a strong sense of justice.</p>
<p align="left">The antagonists have also been revealed - a military nation 
conducting secretive tactics, named Tsaparang. Tsaparang is a mysterious country 
excelling in science and military power. They contact Matthew and co. for 
unknown reasons and at times seem to be making use of them. They appear in many 
places.</p>
<p align="left">The male commander is named Spade. He is a warlike swordsman. 
The female commander is named Heart. She uses her bewitching beauty to get close 
to important people in other countries.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>13th October 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">Two new videos have emerged.</p>
<p align="left">
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4r4tIw5d20&amp;feature=sub">

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4-yxQw2Gg&amp;feature=sub</a></p>
<p align="left">The video shows we'll indeed be getting a ship (Most likely 
Eoleo's) Another interesting thing is a scene with Spade holding Rief (Oh yeah, 
I should mention that Crown's English name was recently revealed to be Rief) 
hostage. There's a blue-haired person standing behind them with a mask on his 
face and his hairstyle is similar to Alex's. Hmm.</p>
<p align="left">The second Jupiter Adept (whose silhouette can currently be seen 
on the Japanese site) is also shown. Her name is Stella.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>14th October 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">The Japanese site has updated, with Stella, and also the two 
other silhouettes put up last week have been revealed as Isaac and Kraden. 
Kraden is in fact Rief's mentor.</p>
<p align="left">Translation of Stella's bio: &quot;Man-Beast Adept. A member of the 
man-beast race who mutated after the rising of the Golden Sun. Her senses are 
highly enhanced and she also possesses the ability to read minds, can detect 
special smells, and is able to visualize Psynergy.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Kraden's bio: &quot;A scholar of alchemy with extensive knowledge 
from his travels around the world. The teacher of Rief, he travels around 
researching alchemy. Previously, he had traveled together with the Warriors of 
Vale.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Isaac's bio: &quot;The leader of the Warriors of Vale who caused the 
Golden Sun 30 years ago. An earth adept, the father of Matthew. He built a cabin 
on the Goma Hill opposite the collapsed Mt. Aleph, to observe and watch for any 
strange occurrences.&quot;</p>

The Adepts You Meet On Your Journey <br>
-Companions- <br>
<br>
Schlater, who travelled with the previous protagonist Robin and was deeply 
involved in their adventure, makes an appearance. A happy performance for 
players of the game. On the other hand, a race which appears after the Golden 
Sun Effect. Called 'Manbeast', it is a sub-race which evolved suddenly from <br>
humans and animals. This time, we introduce one of the new race, Stella! <br>
<br>
Schlater: It'd be good if you can meet Muuto and the others safely. <br>
Arrow &gt; It seems like he will help Muuto and the others on their journey with 
his knowledge, like he did with Isaac. <br>
<br>
Stella: That's right... I am Stella. It's true, I am a Manbeast. <br>
Arrow &gt; Stella, who admits to being a Manbeast. What do the people in the 
changing world think about human-beasts? <br>
<br>
Schlater <br>
Arrow to Crown: Teacher and Student <br>
A scholar of alchemy with extensive knowledge. A scholar who has studied alchemy 
for a long time. The master of Crown, he travels around the world with them and 
tags along even in the face of danger, to set foot in ancient ruins. He is an 
old friend of Robin's. <br>
<br>
Schlater: In the long time that I've known Robin, I am glad to have been of 
help... By the way, Crown, what are you doing? <br>
Arrow &gt; Schlater, who travelled with Robin and the other Warriors of Vale before 
the rising of the Golden Sun. It seems that close acquaintanceship continues 
even now. <br>
<br>
Stella: T-thank you... <br>
Controlling the Wind, Reading Minds <br>
<br>
Stella cast Tornado Spin! <br>
Wing Rat took 132 damage! <br>
<br>
Lots of adventures await in Weyard <br>
The world that is the stage of our story, Weyard. It is a land with lots of 
different landscapes (scenaries) and many different races. In the many ancient 
ruins around, strong enemies and puzzle-traps await. A band of very cute 
human-beasts (note, this is not the same word used for <br>
Stella's Manbeast) <br>
<br>
(Fourth page) <br>
<br>
Stella <br>
The Evolved Adept <br>
A young girl of the manbeast race, she can control the wind freely. Like a 
beast, her five senses surpass those of a human. It appears that besides reading 
the minds of another and sensing special smells, unlike the other adepts, she 
can use psynergy that are unique to manbeasts. <br>
<br>
Arrow &gt; Using a ship to travel the oceans... Inferring from the building in the 
bottom right, there is also a country with a Japanese-style culture. <br>
<br>
Arrow &gt; The spouting water has blocked the road. There seems to be a psynergy 
that can deal with this mechanism, but what catches the eye is the time counter 
below. What exactly is that...? <br>
<br>
Arrow &gt; An ancient ruin, with a crossing of many gears. The footholds ae on 
differing height levels, but can they be changed with psynergy? <br>
<br>
The giant section with djinn basically talks about Set, Standby and Summon.</p>

Description as it apparently spoils the location where the climax of the game 
takes place. Way to go, Amazon...)</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://imgur.com/X0kzO.jpg">A new image</a> has shown 
official art for Halmarny, and also revealed the second Venus Adept, Himi. From 
what could be made out from the text, it appears Halmarny is the prince of the 
Water Kingdom, Ayatayu, and Himi is a seer who possesses powerful Psynergy.</p>
<p align="left">In other news, Famitsu gave Dark Dawn a score of 33/40 (9/8/8/8)</p>

<p align="left">Japanese site updated again, with new character bios.</p>
<p align="left">Harumani - A wise Water Adept born into a royal family. He bears 
a complicated destiny due to his own birth being wrapped in mystery.</p>
<p align="left">Himi - Earth Adept and Priestess of Yamatai. She inherited 
mysterious powers from the bloodline of her priestess mother. It seems that she 
is able to hear divine messages.</p>
<p align="left">You'd think we would be done with site updates with the game 
coming out next week, but no. There's yet another silhouette on the &quot;Others&quot; 
page, beneath the &quot;Tsaparang&quot; heading. This figure bears more than a passing 
resemblance to Alex...</p>
<p align="left"><strong>25th October 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">Some new Japanese scans have emerged.</p>

<p align="left">Matthew's mom is confirmed according to the first scan. It is 
also stated that Karis is Ivan's daughter and Rief is Mia's son.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>28th October 2010</strong></p>
<p align="left">The Japanese site has updated with the final character bio, 
named &quot;Ace&quot;. It's pretty obvious though that Ace is Alex, wearing an opera mask.</p>
<p align="left">Bio: <span>The masked man working together with Spade's group.<br>
<br>
It seems like the warriors of Vale know his face, yet his true nature/identity 
is shrouded in mystery. Together his actions and those of Matthew's company will 
have a great impact upon the fate of the world.</span></p>
