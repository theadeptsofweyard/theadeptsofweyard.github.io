<p align="left">Here we go. The infamous fake Golden Sun game for the DS which 
was first shown on Golden Sun Realm and revealed as an April Fool's joke. It was 
made by a person named TakaM. However, TakaM made one glaring error which nobody 
managed to catch at first, me included. I feel so ashamed... but, anyway... the 
title reads &quot;Ougon no Taiyou: Arekkusu no Michi (Golden Sun: Alex's Path)&quot; Hold 
on! &quot;Arekkusu&quot;? Who is this Arekkusu? There is a person named Alex, but his name 
is spelled <i>Arekusu </i>in Japanese. So, yeah, there lies the error. </p>
<p align="left">Also, the Japanese TLA cart for the DS has a gold background, 
not blue. But it was nice that this person could at least make the effort to 
write stuff in Japanese. Honestly, how hard is it to just get the game's name 
written in Japanese, add a little Japanese below... I should save that rant for 
later.</p>

<p><i>Golden Sun: The Solar Soothsayer</i></p>
<p><img border="0" src="solar1.jpg" width="272" height="472"><img border="0" src="solar2.jpg" width="425" height="407"></p>
<p>This fake caused quite an uproar when it appeared on some minor gaming sites. 
However, other sites were quick to decry it as simply being a fake, so opinions 
were divided. However, as time passed, flaws were soon found. Firstly, the game 
is in English. Camelot always announced their games before they were even 
released in Japan and released first screenshots in Japanese, so obviously the 
first shots of a new game should be in Japanese, not English. </p>

<p>Now, people, let's play Spot the Difference! What differences can you see 
between the title screens of Golden Sun/Golden Sun: The Lost Age and Golden Sun: 
The Solar Soothsayer?</p>
<p>If you guessed the Nintendo/Camelot part, you are correct. The error in 
question is... the lack of a copyright symbol! It makes no sense for them to not 
put the copyright symbol in, does it?</p>
<p>Also, the usage of old official art that Camelot drew years ago? I'd really 
like to think they would draw new art for a new game. Also, the Gaia Falls shot 
on the top part could easily be taken from the game or the map itself.</p>
<p>The creator, Opium, soon stepped up, admitting that he had made the fakes 
himself and explained everything in an
<a href="http://www.vooks.net/modules.php?module=article&id=12036/">interview at 
Vooks.net</a>.</p>

<p><i>VGBoxArt Fakes</i></p>
<p>For the record, anything that is from the site VGBoxArt is a fake. It is a 
site where you can design your own box art covers for made-up games and submit 
them to the site. </p>

<p>I have simply covered the most famous of the fakes, though there probably are 
a few more obscure ones floating around out there. I really hope to not see any 
more fakes rising to fame any time soon. It's kind of annoying, after all. I'd 
like to see real games from Camelot. Hear that, Camelot?</p>
