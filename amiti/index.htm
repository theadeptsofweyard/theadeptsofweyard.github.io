<p><img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Welcome to the... Love... Shack...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> You seem to be having a hard time saying it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> He's even going red.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I... why am I getting this section anyway? This is absurd!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> It's kind of ironic. I mean, you didn't even know how babies were made.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I do know how babies are made, thank you very much!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Really?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Yes, really. Ahem. This is where shipping stuff goes, apparently. 
Whatever that means.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Ooh, ships? Can we talk 
about my dad's ship? It's awesome-<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Not that kind of ship.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Er, then what kind of 
ship do you mean?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Relationships. 
Obviously.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Oh, relationships. I 
can't say I know very much about that sort of thing myself. Perhaps I can learn 
something.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> ... Or you can wait for 
your parents to teach you. Seriously. I don't want to get into trouble here...</p>

<p>Coming soon.</p>
