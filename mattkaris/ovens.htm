I love ovens~<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> What do people 
eat in the places that don't have ovens?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Fruit?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Didn't they have 
that raw fish in Yamata? Gross.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Actually, raw fish 
is quite nice to eat.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Really?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> I don't think they 
would be eating it if it wasn't. We beastmen aren't opposed to consuming raw 
meat either.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Wow, really?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Um, doesn't it 
make you sick?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Not at all. Our 
digestive systems are quite capable of handling it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Well, that's, er, 
fascinating.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> I just had a 
random thought. This page should totally be titled "Food Porn".<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> We are not naming 
the page that!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Boo... you're no 
fun. What do you think, Matthew?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> I know better 
than to go against Karis.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" />You're so smart, 
Matthew. Now then, go and check out the culinary treats Angara and other places 
have to offer. </p>
