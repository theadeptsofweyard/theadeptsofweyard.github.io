<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> What's wrong with 
my disguise?! Everybody makes fun of it...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> You!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Yes. Me. What about 
me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Is it true you 
contributed your sperm to my creation?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> You mean, am I your 
father?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Er. Yes. Yes... 
that's what I mean.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Hm, what was your 
mother's name?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Y-you bastard! Are 
you saying you've screwed so many women, you don't even-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> No. I've only ever 
slept with one. Good grief. Fine, was her name Veriti?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> So it's true!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Meh, not a lot of us 
super mysterious blue haired people around. Not too hard to figure out.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Yeah, and 
Lemurians never even leave. Except for Piers, but he would never abandon a 
pregnant woman.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> That's right! 
Captain Piers is a charming, noble, righteous man... and he's so hot! *swoon*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Nowell? Why are you 
here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Oh, you remember me, 
do you? And it took you ages to ask about me too!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> H-how did you...? 
Master Kraden?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> *whistle*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Mia's spawn, I take 
it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Ah, it's Alex! The 
scourge of the earth! An evil bastard who only loves himself and-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Just what has Mia 
been saying about me?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Alex? That Alex? The 
bottom dwelling scum sucker and an absolute creep who probably still wets the 
bed?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> You guys are making 
this "Alex is my father" revelation a lot harder, you know.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> He's your father?! ... 
Oh well, Tret did make that pretty obvious anyway.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> You poor thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Sigh. I'm leaving. 
*warps out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Wow, is it 
possible his miniscule feelings are capable of being hurt? Nah, it couldn't be.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Anyway, when is that 
fourth game coming out?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Er...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> I've been waiting so 
long for my chance to shine as an actual playable character, get my own official 
art and find true love at the end with my beloved Captain Piers...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> It sure is taking a 
while...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> In the meantime, 
we're just going to... I dunno, hang out?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Are we ever going to 
find out what's up with that gigantic Psynergy vortex?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> To end on a 
cliffhanger like that and not quickly release the sequel seems cruel.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Alex really is my 
father...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> You still on that? 
Yeah, sure, your dad's a dick but so what? It don't make you a dick or anything.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Honestly, I'm 
amazed. Alex always seemed so in love with himself, to think he'd bed a woman...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Whoah, what's this 
about Alex bedding women?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Never mind that, 
he's still alive? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Surely we all knew 
he wasn't really dead.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Man, what a sloppy 
job that Wise One did, not bothering to finish him off.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Don't say that! Amiti 
wouldn't have been born otherwise.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Amiti?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> That's me...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Huh.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> You are Isaac, right? 
I predicted you were in grave danger some tiime ago. I wonder what that was 
about.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Hmm... well, there 
was this moment when I was wondering where that copy of the Sun Saga I keep in 
the bookshelf was...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Oh yeah, I took it. 
Sorry.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Jenna was there, 
and she overheard him... things got a little heated. Honestly, Isaac, why did 
you even have a copy?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Well... I... it's 
not like I had the entire series!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> That doesn't 
seriously count as grave danger, does it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Clearly, you've 
never seen Jenna in one of her worse moods.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> It's possible this 
grave danger hasn't come to pass yet... maybe.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Oh, great. Do I 
have to watch my back?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Hmm. Who'd want to 
get even with you, I wonder... gosh, I can't think of anyone at all.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Your sarcasm is 
unappreciated.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Well, it's certainly 
not me. I had better things to do than go after you, contrary to what fanfic 
writers thought. Geez, they thought I'd be obsessed with you or something.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Dark Dawn may have 
been a bad game, but at least it wasn't using a plotline done to death in 
fanfiction, huh?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Why are you back?! I 
wanted to quietly angst over my daddy issues. How can I do it with you right 
there?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Geez, okay. Let me 
know when you're done angsting. *warps out*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Aaaaaaangst...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Amiti's taking this 
hard.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Should we try to 
cheer him up?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I don't think daddy 
issues are the kind of thing that go away with just a little cheering up.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Hmm, does anyone else 
have daddy issues to talk about?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Who's your daddy, 
anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Sure is weird how 
our kids never met Mia's before the journey. What's up with that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> I know. right. To 
think they ended up travelling with Kraden of all people and still...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Uh... er... you see... 
it's... classified information!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Yup! Classified 
information!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Uhh...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Come to think of 
it, I don't even know who my wife is. Weird!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Huh? How can you not 
know who my mother is... my... mother... I... can't even remember her face...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> What, you really 
can't? Heck, I know the face of my mother.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Oh my gosh... I don't 
know my mother's face either... I'm an awful child...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> To be honest, I don't 
remember what my father's face looks like either...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Okay, guys, maybe 
there's a good reason for this...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> 
Aaaaaaaaannnnnngst...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Crap, it's 
spread...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Come to think of 
it, where's my mother? Nobody said anything about her at the camp...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> You don't know?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> My dad said to tell 
her how sorry he was, and yet... where even was she? I don't understand!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Things are taking an 
unpleasant turn. I am thankful to know who my parents are and where they are.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> My parents are dead.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> I'm sorry to hear 
that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> It's fine. We should 
try to cheer up our friends somehow. Do you have any ideas?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Hmm. I could try 
emoting at them, but they might take it the wrong way like people always do.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> It's a pity Captain 
Piers and Takeru can't be here.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Oh, that's right, my 
big brother is supposed to be travelling with you, isn't he?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Right, but they have 
never appeared in the game and therefore have no face icons. Oh, how cruel, to 
think I can't be with my Captain Piers on these fair webpages until a fourth 
Golden Sun game is to come out...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Dial it back a bit, 
sis, you're seriously starting to sound nuts.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> At least I'm not 
despised by the fandom for being a nerdy Kraden wannabe.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> ... sob. *runs off*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Hey! What's wrong 
with wanting to be like me?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Hmm...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> *whistles*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/nowell.png" width="32" /> Meh, he deserved it. 
I can't believe he took so long to remember me when there were rampaging 
monsters killing everyone. Jerk.<br />
