<p class="auto-style1">Tyrell's Interview</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It's interview time again, yay~ Now who will my unfortunate victim 
be... ahh, yes, how about Tyrell?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Eh? Me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Yes, you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Uh... what do I have to do?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Just answer the questions. It's a piece of cake.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> I like cake.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> ... Uh, sure. You're not actually getting cake for doing this, you 
know.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Aww...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Let's get on with this, shall we? Question 1: Do you actually, you 
know, possess a brain?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Um. I think so.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Are you sure?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Seriously, that's mean...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It takes a special kind of dumbassery to jump off a cliff.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> ... Yeah, yeah. Sigh.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Okay, character bashing gets old fast so let's move on. Question 2: 
So, who's your mom?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Eh, why do you want to know that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> The entire fandom wants to know! Why the heck don't we know who she 
is? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> My mom's dead.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Yes, but...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> And I don't know who she is either.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> You. Don't?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Nope. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> ... Sigh. I guess it wouldn't be that easy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> That particular detail about my mom being dead would have been in the 
game, but they had to go and change things.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And so we never got to see Kalay, Bilibin, Ivan, and Jenna.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> That sounds like it would have been so much better than searching for a 
feather.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> A feather for a device you broke.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Oh. Yeah. Haha. Whoops?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Sigh. Question three: What are your thoughts on being basically fanon 
Garet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Fanon... Dad? What's fanon?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> You know. Stuff fandom comes up with. Like Garet being dumber than a 
bag of bricks and unable to think of anything but food. Things like that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Huh... well, I have no idea what to think.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> No, I suppose you wouldn't. Boy, this ten question format got old a 
long time ago... I should come up with something different.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Could we do something that makes me come across as totally cool so I can 
impress Karis?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question four: Do you honestly think you have a chance with Karis?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Um. Well. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Half the time, it seems like she wants to murder you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Well, yeah, I guess I do get on her nerves sometimes. She can be a bit 
bossy, you know? Always nagging...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And you're still interested in her?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> I guess I must be a bit of a ma... maso... cheese... no, that's not 
right...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> The word is masochist.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Right! Masochist! Anyway, Karis is pretty cute.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Anyway, if Camelot did Generation Xerox again, god forbid, you'd 
probably get the Garet, Ivan and Mia treatment. Who are we kidding though, there 
might not ever be a Golden Sun 4 let alone 5...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Not sure what that means, but okay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question five: What the hell happens after you see the damn giant 
Psynergy vortex?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> What makes you think I can even answer that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I want to know already! It's been years! Years!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> You sure are asking me a lot of stuff I can't even answer. Are you just 
here to rant?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question seven: Why am I so inconsistent with how I write numbers?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> You are?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And why can't I ever think of anything new to ask?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> That was two questions.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Oh, you can count. Very impressive. Garet must be so proud of you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Geez... you really aren't in a very good mood today.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Maybe I would be in a better one if Camelot announced a fourth game 
already.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> By the way, you skipped six.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Let's pretend seven was six and the question I asked after that was 
seven.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> I get the feeling you are really half assing things here.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I'm not 15 anymore, I can't always come up with random nonsense on 
the spur of the moment. How I wish I could.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Okay...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question eight: How many of you would it take to screw in a 
lightbulb?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> What's a lightbulb?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Exactly. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> ... Yeah, this is really pointless. I'd rather just go eat... er, I 
mean, fight monsters or something. And look totally cool doing it. *stomach 
rumbles* Uhh... gosh, I wonder what that noise was.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question nine: Does your Uncle Aaron look like a man now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> What? Of course he does.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Good for him. Your aunt and uncle doing well?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Er, yeah. My dad's family all live in Kalay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And I suppose your aunt has flowers.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Er... I do remember her getting mad at me for treading on flowers once.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Oh dear. Question ten: Are you looking forward to the showdown with 
Kraden's pigeon?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Eh? The what?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> You know. The pigeon. Personally, I'm betting on the pigeon myself.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Seriously? How could a pigeon beat me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Fool. Someone as amazing and legendary as Kraden could only have an 
amazing and legendary pigeon to match.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> ... I really don't know about calling that old fart amazing and 
legendary.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> You don't get it at all. You poor thing. May Kraden save your soul.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> You are honestly kind of nuts sometimes, you know that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Why, thank you!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> ... That wasn't really supposed to be a compliment.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Now then, let's see what everyone has to say about Tyrell!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> We're like 
brothers, but boy, he can be... yeah.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Tyrell is a real 
handful. It's frustrating. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> This guy. He is 
certainly... lacking in the brains department. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I know he's not that 
smart, but he's still a friend. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> A very brash young 
man for sure. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Everyone going on 
about brains this or brains that, does it really matter? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Tyrell is Tyrell.&nbsp;
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> *sighs and shakes 
head* <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> I know my son is a 
bit challenged, but hopefully he'll grow out of it. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> If Garet's son 
turned out like this, I shudder to think what Tyrell's son would be like. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Not really a 
surprise how he turned out, considering his fire headed oaf of a father. <br />
