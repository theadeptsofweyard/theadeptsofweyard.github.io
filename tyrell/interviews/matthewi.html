<p class="auto-style1">Matthew's Interview</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Well 
then, let's begin... our new series of interviews, with the Dark Dawn cast! 
Let's start off with Matthew!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Um. Okay then. So I 
just answer questions?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Sure.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Okay. I'm good at 
that. Do I also get to show off my range of emotions and end up accidentally 
invoking the wrath of the wrong people because I had no idea who they were 
supposed to be aimed at?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> ... No, you don't 
have to do that part.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Alright then. Go 
ahead.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Well then. 
Question one! Were the circumstances of your birth entirely natural?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> ... What?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Like, are you 
really Jenna's biological son?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Of course I am! Why 
wouldn't I be?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> You're really not 
a clone of Isaac?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> .............<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Seriously, you 
look way too much like him.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> I know.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Oh well, jokes 
aside... Question 2: &nbsp;Why doesn't your mom live at the outlook cabin?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Um. It's... 
dangerous.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Bullshit. Jenna's 
probably more dangerous than every eclipse monster, Dullahan, Star Magician, 
Ancient Devil and Ogre Titans combined. What's the real reason?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> You make my mom 
sound like a monster.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
^_^<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Sigh. Honestly... well, she lives in Kalay. My father prefers her to stay there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
So he can have uninterrupted nookies with Garet, right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
What?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
It's okay. Everybody already knows.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
It's not like that! What the heck is wrong with you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
*smirk*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
... You are nuts, you know that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
I know. Okay then. Question three: What are your thoughts on the Sun Saga?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Er... it's... okay, I guess.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Do you believe it to be an accurate depiction of the journey?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Well, judging from what I've heard from Dad and Garet, it leaves a lot out so 
maybe not. Mom hates it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
I'm sure she does. Has she hunted down and killed the author of the Sun Saga 
yet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
She wouldn't do that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Matthew, Matthew, Matthew... nah, you're right. But, man, I'm way too 
entertained by the thought of what she'd do to the author. But this isn't the 
place for that. Question four! Is that Isaac's scarf?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Er, yes, he handed it down to me.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Cool. It's pretty old though, isn't it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Yeah, but it's in pretty good shape.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
I wonder how much monster blood got on it over the years. Gross.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
... It's clean.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Good, good. Well, Question five. Is it tough being a mute protagonist?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
It sure is.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Yeah?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Every time I emote, someone gets mad at me or just misunderstands what I'm 
saying. It's hard. I wish I could just talk.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
You poor thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
But, you know, my dad says he was only able to say 'yes' and 'no'.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Yeah, well, I think that was better.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
It was?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Uh huh. The emoticon system is so poorly executed. I wonder why they bothered...
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
I see...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Oh well. Question six! Do you use hairgel?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Um, what's hairgel?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
It's gel. You know?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are talking about.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
So your hair naturally sticks out like that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
What's so strange about that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Gravity defying hair is kind of cool...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Um. Okay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Anyway~ Question seven! Is your dad evil?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
What? Why would you even ask that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
He made you sit through that Djinni tutorial, didn't he?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Well, yes.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Even though he knew the pain of sitting through a forced Djinni tutorial from 
the start of his own adventure.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Uh... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Therefore he must be evil. Why else would he make you suffer the same fate?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Oh come on, it wasn't that bad.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
It is when you replay the game! And all those other tutorials! Oh my god. Did we 
really need to be shown how to move the stump when we'd only just attempted to 
move it ourselves? I swear Isaac is evil.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Okay... I'll just leave you to your delusions.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Ahem. Question eight: Why does the lookout cabin only have two beds?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
What are you getting at now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Do Isaac and Garet share a bed?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Sigh. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
I guess it's the inn thing all over again...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
What are you talking about?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Never mind. 
Question nine: What do you think of beastmen?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Uh... they are 
okay? I have no problem with them?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Would you actually 
date one? *coughlikeSvetacough*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Dating...? Uhh, 
well, I haven't even thought about that, but I don't think it would be too 
weird...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Probably keep you 
really warm at night.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Er. I guess so. 
They are just humans with fur. Nothing strange about it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Wonder what your 
dad and mom would think about you being a potential furry.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Huh? But I don't 
have fur? I don't think dating beastmen turns you into one either.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> ... You are so 
innocent.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> I don't see how my 
not understanding all the strange words you throw at me makes me innocent.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> So you're not 
innocent? Okay, fess up.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> I didn't say that!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> One day, I will 
expose your dirty secrets. Muahahaha... okay, seriously, question ten. Why the heck does Briggs say you have your mother's eyes? That's 
weird...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
Is it...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Hell yes. I mean, Jenna's eyes are maroon or brown or whatever, but yours are 
blue. Just like Isaac. Man, did any of her genes get transferred to you like, at 
all? Are you really not a result of parthenogenesis and some bizarre MPreg 
shenanigans?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
You what?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
You heard me.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />
I didn't even understand any of that last sentence.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" />
Geez. Alright, interview over. Let's hear everyone's thoughts on Matthew.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Matthew's my best 
bud. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> It really is hard to 
tell who he's emoting at sometimes. If only I actually had the power to read 
minds...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Hm, yes. Matthew is a 
good friend.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> I am pleased to have 
met him. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Er. Matthew is... 
*blushes* a fine man. Yes. I'm very grateful to him. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Eh. He's a good 
kid. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Matthew is Matthew. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> My son has become a 
fine warrior. Just a pity about the whole accidentally starting the apocalypse 
thing, but at least they fixed it. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> Matthew's been a 
great help in raising my son. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Matthew looks so 
much like his father, it's astounding. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> Hm. Yes. The spawn 
of Isaac. I wonder where his adventures will take him next.</p>
