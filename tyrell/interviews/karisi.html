<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It's that time again and my next victim... I mean, interviewee will 
be Karis!</span><span style="font-size: 14.666666666666666px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><br class="kix-line-break" />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Ooh, it's my turn? I'll do my best!<br class="kix-line-break" />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I see you're eager to do this. Good. Now then, question one! Why 
don't you have Mind Read?! ;~;<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Um... huh?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> *sniff* Seriously, how can you not have it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> O_o;;; I... just don't...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It makes no sense! Ivan has it! Sheba has it! Even that guy Nyunpa 
had it, so why?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Umm... I'm sorry?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Hmph. I bet the lazy Camelot writers just didn't want to give 
everyone a readable mind. Jerks. And those points of no return-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Ahem. Before you start on a rant, can I remind you of the interview we're 
meant to be doing?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Oh, right. That. But, seriously, no Mind Read really sucks... so does 
not having Reveal...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Oh, Reveal. Isn't that the cool Psynergy that lets you find hidden stuff? 
... Yeah, my dad didn't get round to teaching me that...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Well, he should have. Curse you, Ivan! *shakes fist* Anyway, question 
two! Does your dad still look like a shota?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Ehh? What's a shota? And aren't these questions supposed to be about me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It would be funny if he still looked like a teenager.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> No, he definitely looks old enough to be my dad, but I guess that will 
change soon enough.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Man, I can't imagine how weird that's going to be in the future.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I'd rather not think about it at all...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Fair enough. Question three! So I hear you mastered a Wooden Stick.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I... did? You mean the weapon, right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> That's quite the accomplishment. How did it feel?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> How is it an accomplishment? That was, like, one of the first weapons I 
ever used. Pretty basic.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, I suppose so...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I'm sure I've mastered a lot of weapons by now. Like bows too.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It was cool that Dark Dawn added bows.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Bows are pretty fun to use.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question four! What is your biggest pet peeve?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Hmm... Tyrell.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Uh... okay.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Seriously, he's so annoying! He never listens to me and he's always up to 
mischief and...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Childhood friends, huh...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Man, if it wasn't for Matthew, I'd probably have snapped a long time ago.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> O_o; Yeah, I suppose that's a good thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> How can he so dumb? I just don't get it at all.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Oh well. Question five. Do you know your aunt Hama?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Sure, she comes to Kalay once in a while.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I see...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Aunt Hama's pretty nice. She lives in Contigo, which is pretty far 
away... I've never been there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, who knows where Contigo even is now with the world randomly 
shifting places around in thirty years. And don't get me started on these 
ancient civilizations suddenly appearing out of nowhere.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> She mentioned a temple once. It was called Lama Temple. Llamas are 
cute...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Wait, what?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I wish I could go and pet a llama, but I don't know where that temple is.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Good question. Xian and Altin kinda just randomly vanished too. Who 
the heck knows where they got to...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Isaac and Garet spoke about all these places they saw on their journey, 
but we hardly saw any of them.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question six, so where did your green hair come from?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Er... I wonder.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> You are the first character with a portrait to have green hair.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I am? That's interesting, I guess.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Maybe it comes from your super mysterious unknown mother...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Sorry, I'm forbidden from saying anything on that subject for some 
reason.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Geez. Wish Camelot would make that fourth game and give us details 
already. Question seven! If you learned Mind Read, what's the first thing you'd 
do?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Hmm. That's difficult. I certainly wouldn't want to go prying into 
people's minds without a good reason.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Pfft, who needs good reasons. You know what? You could use Mind Read 
to learn if Tyrell's up to no good.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> I-I could?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Totally. He'd never be able to commit mischief around you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Whoah! I'm gonna ask Dad to teach me right now-<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Hold on, the interview's not over yet. Oh yeah, and Tyrell would know 
if you were reading his mind anyway.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> He would? Ahh, then I don't know...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question eight. So, uh, you and Sveta... you're pretty good friends, 
right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Yup, we're really good friends.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Really good friends... right...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Hm? What is it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Nothing. Nothing at all. *whistle*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Okay... this is one of those moments I think having Mind Read would be a 
good thing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Trust me, my mind is one of the last minds you would ever want to 
look into.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> O_O;;; I have a feeling I don't want to know what you mean by that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> ^_^ Question nine! Have you ever flown anywhere exciting on the 
soarwing? Like places that aren't Kalay or the cabin...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Sadly, that was pretty much my limit. But I should probably be able to 
fly further now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Man, that soarwing's pretty cool... too bad Tyrell broke it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Yeah.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And we spend the entire game getting the feather and the game ends 
before we even give it back... and that cliffhanger...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Uh huh.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question ten. When is Golden Sun 4 coming out?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Wait, what? Why are you asking me?! And that doesn't even have anything 
to do with me...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Can you see the future yet?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Now that would have been a better question, don't you think?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Ahh, you're so nitpicky... well, can you or can't you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Not yet. I sure wish I could though.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I wish Golden Sun 4 would come out already...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> There, there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Oh well, and that concludes the interview. Now, for everyone's 
comments on Karis!<br />
