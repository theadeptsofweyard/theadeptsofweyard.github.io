<p class="auto-style1">Rief's Interview</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Okay, Rief, you're up next.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" />Ah, is it my turn to get interviewed? I shall do my best.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question one: Why the hell am I doing this?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Hmm. Let me see. You are doing this as a series of Adept interviews on 
this website known as The Adepts of Weyard, I believe?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Wow, was that it? I had no idea. Thank you so much.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Hmm, I sense sarcasm in your tone.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question two: Why are you so boring and nerdy?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Sigh. Yes. Everyone seems to think that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I would almost call you a mini Kraden, but that's insulting to 
Kraden.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> *adjusts glasses* I have trained under Master Kraden after all, so it's 
not so strange.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question three: Why can't we play as your sister instead?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Er, well, that would be because my sister did not travel with us.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And that's a crying shame, she was a much cooler character.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Sorry, there is nothing I can do about it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Man... why can't we have Golden Sun 4 already?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Are you going to turn every interview into complaining about the lack of 
Golden Sun 4?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It's been almost a decade! A decade!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Ah yes. About nine years now. Quite the long time indeed.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And all I can do is wait.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Hopefully, someday...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question four: So why are you hiding the identity of your father?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I am?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Of course you are.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Er. I cannot disclose the identity of my father because reasons.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It's totally Kraden, isn't it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Excuse me?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> How else could Mia have spawned some boring, nerdy Kraden wannabe?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Can you come up with other adjectives besides boring and nerdy?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Hell no, you boring nerd.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I see. How can I make people see me as anything other than a boring nerd?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Get a personality.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Sure. I'll just join the queue.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Of course, a Golden Sun character with character development is an 
anomaly to begin with, but gosh. I think the only one worse off than you is 
Himi.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I got a fair amount more screentime than her.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Everyone did, didn't they? Question five: How come it took you so 
damn long to remember your own sister?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I am thoroughly ashamed of myself.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Damn right, you should be, she could have been eaten by eclipse 
monsters!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Yes. I am thoroughly repenting for my thoughtlessness.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> And who ever knows where she went off to. Maybe we'll never know... 
no, I can't lose hope!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I would certainly like to know too.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question six: What are your thoughts on your sister falling for a man 
over a hundred years old?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> You know... I hear he doesn't look that old.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Well, no, he wouldn't.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> And anyway, I'm not concerned about who my sister falls for. It's her 
choice.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Kinda odd to be dating a man her mother traveled with, to be honest.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> You think so? I wonder what my mother would think.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question seven: Did it honestly not bother you that Mercury 
Lighthouse and Imil were in the eclipse?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> They were?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> .............<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Oh. Oh yes, of course they were. I think.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question eight: Do you often get mistaken for a girl?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Um... I don't like to talk about that...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> So that's a yes, then.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Sigh. Then, yes. It is rather embarrassing. I wonder why.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Eh, you're still young. But that robe... are you aware it looks like 
a dress from the back?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> It... it does?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It certainly does.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I see. I was unaware. I shall have to seek out some new attire in that 
case.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question nine: When did you start studying under Kraden?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Hmm. I was quite young. Very young indeed.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I see... I wonder how that even happened. Did Kraden just randomly 
show up in Imil one day? Was Mia seized by the desire to have her children 
become scholars? I wonder...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I guess?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> It's so weird that Mia never introduced you to Isaac, Garet, Ivan and 
their kids.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Yes, well, she never really leaves Imil.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> So it's their fault for not visiting?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I suppose you could say that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Poor Mia. At least she has Kraden.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Uhh... you aren't serious, are you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> If Camelot isn't gonna tell us anything, I'm free to come up with 
wild crack theories.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Oh boy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Question ten: Have you ever seen your mother doing questionable 
things with snowmen?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> I'm not sure what you mean by questionable.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> What an innocent young thing you are...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Anyway, my mother is not a child so of course she doesn't go playing in 
the snow.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> Playing. That's cute.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> What in the world are you even trying to suggest?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" width="32" /> I wonder. Oh hey, we reached the end, yay! Now what does everyone 
have to say about Rief? Maybe they can come up with something other than 
'boring nerd'.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Hmm. I guess he was 
kinda useful until we got Amiti? Maybe?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Smart kid. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Eh. He's alright, I 
guess. I don't get the whole books thing though. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Tret said we were 
related, huh. Hmm... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Hmm, I can't think of 
anything to say, but he too was a valued travelling companion.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> What is it with 
being smart and having glasses? Is being smart bad for your eyesight?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Rief is Rief. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaacdd.png" width="32" /> Hmm, we never did 
visit Mia, did we? I hope she isn't mad.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garetdd.png" width="32" /> I never thought Mia 
would have Kraden wannabes for kids.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kradendd.png" width="32" /> Rief is a fine and 
promising young student.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alexdd.png" width="32" /> I am disgusted.</p>
