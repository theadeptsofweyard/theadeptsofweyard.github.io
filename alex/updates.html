	 <p><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> There are rumours... 
rumours that Kyarorain actually updates.<br>
	 <img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Uh, she does. 
Occasionally.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Yup, 
about once in a blue moon or so.<br>
	 <img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> We shouldn't ridicule her 
for it too much. I'm sure she has a life.<br>
	 <img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> A life? Whatever is that?<br>
	 <img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Well, anyway, she does 
update sometimes.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> Not 
as much as she used to. Things change over the passage of time, you know? So, I 
present to you the updates page. Whenever Kyarorain updates, the changes 
will be posted here.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> So 
check back about once a decade or so~ Kidding, kidding...<br>
	 <img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> Of course, she'll also make 
a note of when the site last updated on the main page, so don't worry about 
having to check back. </p>

	 <p>Added Events Guide to Piers's Captain Logbook<br>Added page for Skits 
	 section in Felix's Valley (no skits yet though)<br>Reorganized the site,

	 <p>Added something to Random Trivia in Piers's Captain Logbook.</p>
	 <p class="style1">19th November 2015</p>
	 <p>Some new content! ... Sort of. I added an iconfic to the Crack Series in 
	 Ivan's Random Stuff, which was originally made along with the rest but I 
	 didn't put it up before because. Um. It has smut. The old Part 4 is now 
	 Part 5 and the newly uploaded iconfic is Part 4. ... I have every intention 
	 of adding actual new content soon, and I promise it will be family 
	 friendly. Honest. ... Geez, the things I've done to this series. This site 
	 started off so innocent too!</p>
	 <p class="style1">31st October 2015</p>
	 <p>Happy Halloween! Today, I've revamped the site entirely with an easier 
	 to read layout and even restored most of the old content, because I know 
	 people were missing the humour and I was missing it too honestly. Also 
	 rearranged some stuff. Yeah, uh, I guess we can consider this site no 
	 longer in archive mode. It's hard to stay away. My inner child just won't 
	 be silenced after all, and that's fine. I won't be embarrassed by my stupid 
	 humour anymore. O7</p>
	 <p class="style1">04th July 2015</p>
	 <p>I really can't leave this site alone, can I? Well, just doing some cleanup. 
Links on Music and Downloads page updated, joined new fanlistings... I removed 
the doujinshi links from the Downloads page because doujinshi sharing is bad and 
we shouldn't do it.</p>
	 <p class="style1">16th August 2014</p>
	 <p>I know I'm stretching the term archive mode a bit. Anyway, I added some scans 
to the Official Art page, featuring character art of Hama, Hydros, Volechek, 
Susa &amp; Kushinada, and the Belinsk band.</p>
	 <p class="style1">09th July 2014</p>
	 <p>This website is still in archive mode. I just gave it a bit of a 
cleanup.</p>
	 <p>I also added some stuff to the Media section -&nbsp; a couple of pictures to 
the Official Art page, the Dark Dawn special soundtrack to the Music page, and a 
Downloads page with some goodies, which you should check out.</p>
