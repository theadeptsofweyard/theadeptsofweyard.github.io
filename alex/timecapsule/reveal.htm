*sob* How come my section is dedicated to the webmistress?
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Bad luck, Ivan...
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
I'd recommend anyone to run away right now...
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
No! She might obliterate your section on the site!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
No! Not the Valley!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Well, I guess we'd better get on with introducing the stupid webmistress... Caz 
is the coolest!... I so did not say that...
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Serves you right for calling her stupid then...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
My section's probably the smallest on the entire site...
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
...aww... poor baby...
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
You really need to stop patronising people like that...
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Quiet, Piers!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
... my name is Picard T_T Don't call me that...
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Sheba teases everybody...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Anyway, let's roll!

Um, yeah, well... I hate profiles...
</p><p>I'm certifiably insane and I surprise people sometimes. Seriously, you'd 
be surprised at the stuff I can spit out. &gt;_&gt; Heh...</p><p>One day I shall rule 
the world! And Alex will rule beside me, because he wants to rule the world too 
^_^ I'll be the naughty ruler who smacks people who dare <br>
look at me, and Alex will be the kind ruler who commands them to bring me 
Chinese food on the double... ...what? Ok, he'd probably tell people to kiss his 
feet... <br>
*sigh* I'd have Felix beside me! Mmm, Felix ^_^ Or Picard! =D I'd cover Picard 
in whipped cream and... never mind... just a small in-joke...
</p><p>If I was an Adept... I might be a Mars Adept because I love heat, or a 
Venus Adept because I like the outside... on warm days. It's beautiful when 
you're in a plane though! <br>
If it depended on your starsign, I'd be a Mercury Adept because I'm Pisces, a 
water sign. Great... three possibilities... or maybe a Jupiter Adept because I'm 
short.<br>
My favourite place in Golden Sun is... Vale! *smacks Alex upside down his head* 
I don't care if it was going to get destroyed or you were dumb enough to try 
drinking Alchemy <br>
and got more drunk than someone drinking ten gallons of sake every second, you 
don't try to summon storms on it, silly! It's got great music, and it's hilly 
and beautiful, and it's Isaac,
<br>
Garet, Felix and Jenna's hometown! It's also where you start in Golden Sun...
</p><p><u>Favourite music in Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age</u>
</p><p>Elemental Star Room
<br>Sol Sanctum
<br>Vale/Vault music
<br>Venus Lighthouse
<br>Saturos &amp; Menardi's theme
<br>Jenna battle theme
<br>Felix battle theme
<br>Aqua Rock
</p><p>What the heck, nearly all the music's somewhat amazing! But... Agatio and 
Karst's music isn't as cool as Saturos and Menardi's music, so there!
</p><p>...Why did Isaac and co. have to kill Saturos and Menardi?! Then we 
wouldn't have to put up with Agatio and Karst... They died too. Good riddance to 
Agatio, I say. 
<br>
He was not as cool as Satty and Menny and Karst... Karst and Agatio don't even 
get cool nicknames! And Saturos is sexier than Agatio... ... ... WHAAAAAT?
</p><p>Well, anyway, that's about all I'm gonna put in my profile thingy. 
Hehe... probably scared everybody off now... &gt;=)

Goodbye!
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
(Phew) she's gone...
<br><img src="../../icons/alex.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
What did she have to hit me for?!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
You got drunk and tried to summon storms on Vale, you idiot.
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Summoning a storm on the favourite place of someone who's devoted to defending 
you isn't such a good idea...
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Yes! She might see the light!
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Just one more push...
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Saturos... sexier? Ooookay...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
I read her mind once... it wasn't pretty...
<br><img src="../../icons/garet.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
What was she thinking?
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
What colour (whisper, whisper) were...
<br><img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Did you HAVE to share that with us?!
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
I'm going to have nightmares now!
<br><img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
I hope whatever you said was nothing rude!
<br><img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
YOU, sexier than me?! No way!
<br><img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Agatio, have you ever looked in a mirror?
<br><img src="../../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
I am much cuter than my big sister, so nyah!
<br><img src="../../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
I try, but they crack!
<br><img src="../../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
CUTER? No way!
<br><img src="../../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Hah hah! My mirrors NEVER crack! Hahaha!
