Hi, welcome to my office!
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Technically, its OUR office.
<br><img src="../../icons/felix.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Its where we work on the site!
<br><img src="../../icons/isaac.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Where we actually all work together, or try to...
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Under the ever watching eye of the evil webmistress too.
<br><img src="../../icons/sheba.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Only Adepts ever get to do anything here...
<br><img src="../../icons/piers.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Only Adepts get to do the work obviously, otherwise why call this place 'ADEPTS 
of Weyard'?
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
And you get to discover who WE are! Lucky you!
<br><img src="../../icons/alex.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Isn't that what the profiles page is for?
<br><img src="../../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
No, it's different to Ivan's Reveal/Picard's Captain Logbook
<br><img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
It's US, as in US who are forced to slog on with this excuse for a site.
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
HAMA!!!
<br><img src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
That's Master Hama to you, squirt.
<br><img src="../../icons/ivan.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Watch it, sister, she's the WEBMISTRESS...
