<center>The Webmistress's Absolute Favourite Couples (and why she likes them and 
not other couples)</center>

<p><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
*sniff* It's supposed to be my section of the site, why does the webmistress get 
her own page in MY section?
<br><img src="../../icons/kyavatar.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Because I wanted to! Plus, it fits!
<br><img src="../../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Hmph... well, do what you like...

Thank you!

<br>Preferred Couples<br>~*~*~
</p><p><b>Isaac/Mia-</b> Isaac/Mia is so popular, and I can definitely see why!&nbsp; 
They definitely look very cute together. And Mia trusts Isaac so much, she said 
so- love has to depend on trust, really!- and she was thankful to him for 
helping her through many troubles. And Mia was so concerned about Isaac during 
Colosso, even scolding Garet for shouting at Isaac even though Garet's Isaac's 
best friend and Isaac's probably used to it. Isaac's first word is &quot;Mia&quot;... and 
the fact is, he yelled for Mia rather than Garet. How very interesting.</p><p><b>
Garet/Jenna</b>- Garet seems to care a lot about Jenna, he just can't seem to 
shut up about her. And they are both Pyromaniacs, too. Oh, and they are 
childhood friends and both live in Vale too. I think they are kinda flirting in 
the beginning of Golden Sun. Also on Jupiter Lighthouse, if you let the Adepts 
get nearly killed, Garet's like &quot;Those monsters! How could they do that to 
Jenna?!&quot; Aww... and in the ending, they walk out of Prox together. And when 
Sheba and Mia tease Garet, Jenna's immediately sticking up for Garet!
</p><p><b>Felix/Sheba- </b>This is obvious. Felix defied Saturos and Menardi to 
save Sheba, and he even jumped off the Venus Lighthouse to save her. He's very 
protective of Sheba, and Sheba's pretty close to him too. If you try to leave 
Idejima without Sheba in the beginning of TLA, she acts sort of flirty, teasing, 
and even speaks in a similar matter when you talk to her in the battle arena.
</p><p><b>Garet/Mia- </b>I just think that these two go together well, plus fire 
and water are opposites, they also have opposite personalities, and opposites 
attract.. Mia was quite worried about him on Jupiter Lighthouse naturally. Um, 
well, they do seem close in the ending cartoon, but if I went with that, I might 
also be supporting Ivan/Kraden...</p><p><b>Isaac/Jenna-</b> They are childhood 
friends, they both live in Vale. Plus, they both lost family on that day of the 
storm, so they have a lot in common. Jenna's often worried about Isaac, she 
doesn't shut up about him easily and when Sheba was teasing her about Isaac in 
Madra, she blushed! Heh, you don't see Jenna blushing very often. Also, in 
Contigo when the two parties meet, Garet says that Isaac has been worried about 
Jenna ever since the journey began or something to that effect.
</p><p><b>Jenna/Alex-</b> There's a pretty big hint in TLA, but we'll get to 
that later. They are Fire and Water Adepts, and I just said opposites attract, 
didn't I? They also look so cute together. And it was Alex who suggested they 
get Jenna out of Sol Sanctum. In TLA, he helps Jenna and Kraden escape the Evil 
Guards of Tolbi/Lalivero/Suhalla/Wherever and if Jenna loses on the way to 
Idejima, he even heals her.
</p><p><b>Mia/Felix-</b> I think Mia and Felix actually look kind of good 
together. Lucky Mia, she always gets the Venus Adepts *grumbles and looks evil* 
Why does she get the Venus Adepts? Why not me? Grrr...
</p><p><b>Ivan/Sheba-</b> They are both Jupiter Adepts! And really cute 
together, plus they can like read each other's mind and stuff. And on the 
Jupiter Lighthouse, Sheba apparently cares more about Ivan's health than Garet 
who is hanging off the lighthouse, because our favourite midget is so badly 
injured. Mean Karst. Also, Ivan apologises to Sheba on the ship because he was 
going on about his newfound home and sister, but Sheba was disappointed because 
she has never found her family.
</p><p><b>Picard/Sheba-</b> I just think this couple seems kinda cute. And they 
are sorta hugging in the ending- although I'm not basing it off that alone but I 
guess it's something. Sheba does seem to be very interested in his age... well, 
she started the whole age thing! And she does say he appears about her age, so 
that's all right... he's only an old man years wise, he just aged slower like 
all Lemurians.
</p><p><b>Felix/Feizhi</b>- I guess this one could come true possibly. I think 
they would look kinda cute together. Feizhi actually mistook Felix for Isaac in 
Champa. Because she's blind.</p><p><b>Ivan/Feizhi- </b>Well, uh... they can both 
see the future, or at least Ivan will because Hama said so, and well, they have 
similar powers huh? And, uh, Feizhi is close to Ivan's sister, Hama!
</p><p><b>Saturos/Menardi</b>- It's obvious, obvious, obvious!
</p><p><b>Picard/Hama</b>- I think this could work. I know I inferred that 
Picard was 14 physically thanks to Sheba, but Hama's probably only like 30 or 
so, and Picard is very mature, especially with manners, he is polite, and could 
be a good match for this Jupiter Adept.</p><p><b>Isaac/Feizhi-</b>&nbsp; When 
you talk to Feizhi after saving Hsu, she's like &quot;Oh, warrior! Welcome!&quot; But if 
you don't save Hsu, then talk to her, she's just, like, &quot;We were able to save 
Hsu...&quot; And if you save Hsu, in TLA, you get given a Gold Ring- she gave it to 
Felix because he knew Isaac and when Kraden said he would give it to Isaac, she 
was happy!</p><p><b>Jenna/Picard</b>- They travelled together... and they are 
opposites, which are supposed to attract. Besides, she might be quite lonely on 
the boat when she's only travelling with her brother, one girl and one guy... so 
wouldn't it make sense to go for the guy?</p><p>~*~*~
<br>Couples I just can't see together or don't want to
<br>~*~*~
</p><p><b>Mia/Alex-</b> This just doesn't work anymore... Mia despises Alex for 
what he has done, betraying the Mercury clan and ultimately using her and her 
friends to try and get what he desired, Alchemy. No way could Mia forgive him, 
she's not that stupid, she'd have to be dumb and blinkered to forgive him for 
everything! I don't think Alex really has feelings for her, that infamous moment 
of weakness in Jupiter Lighthouse when, revealed by reading his mind, he wanted 
to rush to Mia's aid was probably just that, a moment of sudden weakness, due to 
the fact that she is his childhood friend. If he had feelings for her, why would 
he go off without letting her know and then show his face again, admitting he 
lit the beacon? Mia was sick and disgusted with him, there's no way she would be 
seen dead with him ever again, she probably WANTS him dead anyway.
</p><p><b>Isaac/Sheba-</b> I just don't see it... they have no reason to be 
attached to each other...
</p><p><b>Garet/Sheba-</b> I swear Garet was shaking his head 'no' on the Venus 
Lighthouse when Saturos asked him if he cared about what happened to Sheba.
</p><p><b>Mia/Ivan-</b> I think they are very close, but not that close.</p><p><b>
Ivan/Jenna-</b> I just can'tsee this one... I think they're too different, yet 
they have their similarities, so... it's just scary.
</p><p><b>Sheba/Alex-</b> I don't think this one would work out very well...
</p><p><b>Mia/Picard-</b> The only thing they have in common is that they're 
both Mercury Adepts...
</p><p><b>Kraden/Anyone- </b>Who would want to be with Kraden?
</p><p>~*~*~
<br>Slash Couplings I think are cool
<br>~*~*~
</p><p><b>Felix/Picard-</b> It just seems cute! I must have some obsession with 
Mercury and Venus shipping... And its a really popular slash coupling for some 
reason... o_o; I've read quite a bit...
</p><p><b>Felix/Alex</b>- Kinda dropped in popularity after Alex's true colours 
were revealed, but yeah, this was pretty popular once, and it did seem cute... 
maybe its the Mercury/Venus thing... but I still love it to bits!
</p><p>I can tolerate nearly all slash couples really... except Garet/anyone. 
Garet is not slashable. At all.</p><p>Well... that's it...
