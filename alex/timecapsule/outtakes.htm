out, but the content still remains elsewhere on the site.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> So, because there's nowhere else to go, they get put here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Pretty much, yeah.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> People really enjoy our random banter, apparently.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> It's nice to keep as much of this site's history preserved as we can.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> So, yeah. Enjoy the... let's call them The Adepts of Weyard Outtakes. Or 
something like that.<br />

<p>[Isaac's Mountain Hangout]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Welcome to the Mountain Hangout! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> It's where we hang out! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> And the washing too! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hey, who owns those tatty green boxers? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Those are mine, thank you. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Well, washing aside, it's a place to have fun and talk to each other! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Somewhere to chat. Sounds like fun. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Mountains aren't really safe... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Yes, especially when they are covered in snow. An avalanche might 
happen... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Just don't try anything! </p>

<p>[Kay's Archives]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Whoah, we have a new section?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> When was the last time that happened?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Caz actually has something new for the site? Amazing...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> I wanted to put flower wallpaper everywhere... and she wouldn't let me.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Thank Iris...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I wonder what this section is for.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> Basically, Caz's written up some basic guides.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Passing the time until we get more information on the next game is tough.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Well, if it means she actually adds new stuff, it's not so bad.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> Go ahead and look at the guides. I wonder if I could write a guide about 
flowers...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Sis, these are guides for the games, not random crap you write that 
nobody cares about!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kay.gif" width="32" /> How dare you talk to me that way! *slaps*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Owowow... Sis is mean... ;_;</p>
<p>[Feizhi's Misconceptions]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Hello and welcome to my section of the site, I am glad you could drop 
by. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> So what exactly is this section about? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, what sort of misconceptions? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" />: Sometimes people say or think pretty stupid thing, and we're going to 
poke fun at them and explain why they are wrong in some cases... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> So, it's kind of like if people get things wrong, and we laugh at them?
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Sort of... I guess it's going to be a pretty small section... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Which is why we need YOUR help! Email your funny 'misconceptions' to 
kyarorain@gmail.com! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> They have to be real misconceptions which people have actually said...
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> It also helps if you've seen them more than once, but I guess if it's 
only happened once, that's alright... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> And people saying Alex is evil if he's not or vice versa does not 
count... *cough*Caz*cough* <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> That wouldn't really be much of a misconception... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Anyway, let's begin. And thanks for your help! </p>
<p>[Alex's Water of Seeing]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> At last I have my section. My plan to take over the site begins. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Very funny, Alex! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> You couldn't take over a five-person town! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> You two wound me seriously... I am hurt... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Quit talking about yourself and get on with this! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I am here to show you fanart drawn by Caz...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Really, she just links to her stuff on DeviantArt.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Hey! This is MY section! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> She no longer accepts submissions.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, so you can only see her stuff here...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> But do look into the 'water' and feast your eyes on the lovely fanart 
available! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> I thought I was meant to be saying all that stuff... *sigh* <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Hmph, we try to help you and that's the thanks we get... </p>
<p>[Crack Gallery]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /><b> </b>Ever suspected that Kyarorain is on crack?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Suspected? I assumed they knew!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> She doesn't actually take crack. It's illegal, you know.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> But she does like to indulge in doing cracky things from time to time.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Like drawing cracky art for example! Armed with her trusty tablet of 
doom...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> A monster is unleashed. A terrifying monster. Run away!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> If any brave individuals would like to look at her cracky art, they are 
very welcome.</p>
<p>[Jenna's Campfire] (yes, the section is still around. I just chose to revise 
the conversation, so here's the old one.)</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Hello, and welcome to my campfire. Here, you get to sit around the 
campfire and hear elaborate stories! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> And necking? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Of course! ... So long as you're being faithful! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> You never know what might happen in the dark... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Oooooh! I could get away with... stuff! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> You lot are sickening... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Look at Mr. I'm so chilled, I never worry about anybody but Mia! He 
claims not to understand... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Ssh, you shouldn't tease the poor baby, he might cry... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Isn't this campfire supposed to be more about stories than romance? <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I guess it depends really... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Except everybody's always arguing about couples! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Ignore them then... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/feizhi.gif" width="32" /> Hey! I want to join in too! I'm hardly around on the site... *sniff* I 
feel so unloved... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> O_o' <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Excellent, now that just about everybody is here, we can settle around 
the campfire and listen to a story.</p>
<p>[Hama's Magical Portals]</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> I am Hama... descendant of the Anemos... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> She's also... my big sister... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> And a heck of a lot of people thought Hama was Ivan's mother! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Don't blame them... she looks a lot older than Ivan... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> And they have different hair colours... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> But me and Felix don't have the same hair colour! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> But you've got sort of reddish-BROWN hair, he's got dark BROWN hair... 
blonde and purple are drastically different... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Uh... right... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Me, Kay and Aaron all have red hair... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> All Lemurians have blue or green hair... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Menardi's blonde, while her sister Karst has red hair... <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Just accept the fact Hama's Ivan's sister and let her get on with this 
section! <br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/masterhama.gif" width="32" /> Thank you, Mia. </p>

But... Lady Uzume! How could you say such a thing? <br />

... Please. Let me get on with this. <br />

What is this thing for anyway? <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../icons/uzume.gif" width="32" /> 
Well, Caz often updates but neglects to tell people WHAT she's updated. Thus, 
we've decided to contribute with this Updates page so that the viewers will now 
know exactly what Caz has updated... if anything at all. <br />

<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> I sincerely 
doubt anyone's words could ever wound you.<br />

insulting his hair, I bet.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Please refrain 
from insulting my beautiful hair, thank you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> This guy is 
unbelievable sometimes.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Anyway. I got 
lumped with the miscellaneous site-related contents, it seems.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> These sections 
are assigned pretty randomly, aren't they?</p>
<p>
[Jenna's Campfire[</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Welcome to the 
campfire.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Where we sit 
around and tell stories and... stuff. We'll be sure to keep the fire burning 
too.<br />

Psynergy is so useful...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Just don't let 
it get out of control again, okay?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> It's alright, us 
Mercury Adepts can handle accidents easily enough.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Of course, we 
still appreciate it if you are careful.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Okay, get to the 
part where you explain this section already.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> The subject of 
this page is... Kyarorain's fan made content. For example, fanfiction and 
fanart.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> And she sure has 
written a lot of it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Just remember, 
as you venture into the scary world of Kyarorain's fanfiction... be prepared.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Aren't you 
exaggerating just a bit?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> No, not really.</p>

come on, I just want to have a little fun.<br />

don't scare away the visitors, thank you. <br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../_Old/icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> So... 
um... is this fortune telling or what?<br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../_Old/icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Do I get 
to find out my future?<br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../_Old/icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Not 
quite... this site is about the future of the games.<br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../_Old/icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Like, 
sequels?<br />
<img height="32" nosave="" src="../../_Old/icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> That, 
and other kinda related things. If anything major game related happens, it will 
be here. </p>

<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Not that kind of 
ship.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Er, then what 
kind of ship do you mean?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> Relationships. 
Obviously.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Oh, 
relationships. I can't say I know very much about that sort of thing myself. 
Perhaps I can learn something.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> ... Or you can 
wait for your parents to teach you. Seriously. I don't want to get into trouble 
here...</p>
<p>
[Himi's Tent]</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Welcome. This is 
the tent.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> A tent?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Wait, who's 
this chick again?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Uh, that's Himi. 
Remember? She joined us in like the last twenty minutes of our journey.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Oh... yeah. 
Right. <br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Surely it was 
more than twenty minutes...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Well, it's 
just... you didn't have much presence.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> We barely knew 
you to be honest. Sorry.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/himi.png" width="32" /> I see. Well, that 
aside... I believe this section is supposed to be about... uh, character 
introspection? Something like that. It also involves the use of psychic powers.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Uhhhh...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../_Old/icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Please just roll 
with it. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

[The Lemurian Ship]</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Welcome aboard the 
Lemurian Ship!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> It's nice to take a 
break sometimes, isn't it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Battling monsters can 
get so tiresome... and then I get hungry...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, yeah... but it's 
true. I do get tired easily.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Like, sometimes I get 
so fed up, I feel I could just burn things!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> As I've told you many 
times, Jenna, you need to find other ways to unwind.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Yeah well, you're not 
the boss of me. I do what I want!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> Might I suggest some 
reading? There are plenty of books on the ship.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Anyway, if you want 
to just like entertain yourselves, there's plenty of stuff to find here.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> Isn't it nice to 
just be able to put things aside and enjoy ourselves for a while?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> Why, I could almost 
forget that those brats killed us.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> You jumped. Or fell. 
I don't know. And we saved your hometown anyway. Be grateful.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> Grr... okay, Karst, 
keep your cool now. No fighting allowed on the ship.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> That's right, we may 
be antagonists, but we're allowed to have fun too. So, what are we going to do? 
Are we having a sleepover? Can I bring my favourite stuffed bear?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Wait, what?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> I'm going to pretend I 
didn't hear that...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Don't forget about me. 
I know I might have tried to claim ultimate power, but we're all friends here, 
right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Diiiiieeee! *pulls out 
mace*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Which part of no 
fighting don't you understand?!</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
[Isaac and Garet's Lookout Cabin]</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Welcome to the 
Lookout Cabin.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> So, we've got our own 
cabin? Cool.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> You're living in this 
cabin by yourselves?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Where am I in this 
picture anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Well, of course we're 
going to get married and have kids someday, right, Jenna?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> And our kids can come 
and live with us in the cabin too.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Living in a cabin 
together... with your kids...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Well, I think it sounds 
nice and cosy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> What are you getting 
up to then?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Do we really want to 
know?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Ahem. Sheba's 
comments aside, we present to you a guide to the world.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> All the places in 
Weyard, and of course I'll do my best to ensure the food is extensively covered!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Ooh, ooh, are we 
going travelling? I've always wanted to do that! You know, for fun.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
[Sheba's Spotlight]</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Are you ready... to 
go under the spotlight?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> I've had quite enough 
fame, thanks.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Is that why you've 
dropped off the face of the earth in the third game?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> He better have a good 
excuse for that, I swear...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> So few of us even got 
to appear at all...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Yes... it would have 
been nice.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> At least you all get 
mentioned!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Oh, I think we hit a 
sore spot. Sorry, Sheba.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Ugh... anyway. It's 
time to see the characters get their moment in the limelight.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I'm so ready for 
this. So, what do I have to do?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Uh. Sorry, it's for 
side characters.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> ... Bummer.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> We're already the 
main characters. What more do you want?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I'll tell you what I 
want...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Er... and what is 
that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> For those foolish 
mortals at Camelot to bow and grovel before me and beg for my forgiveness then 
give me a starring role in the fourth game! They will rue the day they 
disrespected me! *bursts into maniacal laughter*<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Okay, everyone, don't 
make eye contact. Just back away slowly now...</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Oh my. We'd better be 
careful.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Huh, what is it now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Well, you wouldn't 
want to sail right into that whirlpool there, would you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Whoah, that's a big 
whirlpool. Where did it come from?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> It's awfully strange 
looking. I've never seen water glow in all those colours.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Whoah! Good thing 
that lightning didn't hit us!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> You'd think we would 
have noticed the clouds and lightning before the whirlpool.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> ... Why are the 
clouds purple?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Err, can anyone hear 
eerie music playing or is it just me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> It's a very strange 
whirlpool for sure.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> I wonder what would 
happen if we sailed right into it...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Why on earth would we 
do that?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Umm... I think we 
might be trapped in it already.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Well, it's a very 
strange and mysterious whirlpool, but have no fear, this ship will keep us safe. 
Somehow.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Thank goodness for 
Piers and his ship then.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I'd say now is a good 
time to show our appreciation.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> ...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /><img height="32" src="../../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> 
POW POW PICARD!</p>

[Media]</p>
<p>
<img height="32" src="../../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> Have you come here for 
perusal of the arts?<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> Well, it does say 
"media" right there, so...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> We have a variety of 
fine arts in Belinsk. I will be happy to treat my dear friends the next time you 
all visit.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Aw, thank you, Sveta.
<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> I'm honestly afraid 
to ask what "fine arts" might include...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> Oh, there will be 
none of that, I assure you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> If it's entertainment 
you're looking for, you have come to the right place.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> There has been sadly 
little media released for the games over the years.<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Yeah, like, no 
official artbooks or full soundtracks? Come on now...<br />
<img height="32" src="../../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Still, whatever 
little exist of media for this game series has been gathered and posted here for 
your enjoyment.</p>
