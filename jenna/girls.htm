<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> You know what would be 
fun? if us girls chatted about the boys!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh, that does 
sound like a fun subject!<br><img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
Why not? I'm in... but let's be nice, okay? Unless it's about Alex.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Yeah, ew. Anyway, how 
should we start?<br><img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Hmm, 
how about Isaac? I think he's just so brave and heroic.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That scarf is 
nifty.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> I think he's 
pretty... *blushes* ... hot.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Yeah, I think he's 
definitely kind of cute, quite handsome, yes.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Isaac seems rather 
attached to that scarf.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> I 
suppose his mom must have made it. It's such a long scarf. How does he not trip 
on it?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think so. 
Isaac's been wearing it since we were children. Think it's quite special to him.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Well, that's nice. Nothing 
wrong with that.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To be honest, I 
think he does have some flaws. Like how he just went with what the Wise One 
said...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Really, Isaac has 
flaws?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I mean, I know 
he followed questionable orders, but can you blame him?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We didn't know 
lighting lighthouses would actually save the world!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, true, I 
suppose we shouldn't hold it against him.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> His hometown 
had been robbed and Kraden and I had been kidnapped...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's no wonder 
he'd follow the orders of the village's deity...<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I knew talking 
to him was the right choice. It's a shame it took so long.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We all came 
together and did the right thing in the end so it all worked out.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you really 
have to tell Karst he killed her sister?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why would you 
ever think that was a good idea in the first place?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Believe me, I 
deeply regret it. I just said it without thinking.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I should hope 
so, sheesh. Think before you speak!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What's that, 
Miss "Blurt something out loud while listening to pirates plotting"?!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I... I...!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alright, alright, 
shall we move on? How about Garet?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Hmm, Garet. Well, he's... 
kind of a goofball.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Oh, 
come on, I know he might do some dumb things once in a while, but still.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> Yeah. It's kind of funny, 
really.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> What's with all 
the jokes about him eating too much and being dumb anyway? Like, I know Garet's 
not the brightest tool in the shed, but still!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He does have his 
heroic and caring side. It was so brave of him to jump down after me like that.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right, he's 
such a sweet and loyal guy.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But of course, 
we know who you picked, right, Jenna?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm. Yes. Guess 
it wasn't much of a surprise after all.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Isaac and Garet 
are both perfectly fine men.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Did you never 
have a thing for either of them, Mia?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I, well... I 
mean, I might not have said no, but, well, that's just how things go, you know?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Because it was 
so important the next generation be clones of their parents and not be siblings, 
I guess.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But, anyway, yes, 
Isaac and Garet both have very good qualities, and really, I think Garet's 
faults are emphasised too much.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Right?! People 
are allowed to have flaws, leave them alone!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, okay. 
Calm down now, Jenna...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, how about 
Ivan... he's a smart kid.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ivan, huh. 
Yeah, I guess he does seem like the smart type.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... 
sometimes I wondered if there might be a connection between us.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There is that 
Anemos thing, right?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Mmm, well, 
anyway. I'm kind of envious, honestly.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My, this is 
unexpected. What's got you green, Sheba?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He got to learn 
Reveal in a second off his sister, while I had to climb a rock. He was able to 
find his sister and hometown while I got vague hints. He gets a daughter in the 
third game and is mentioned, while I get nothing! Nothing!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alright, now, 
Sheba. Take a deep breath. None of that is Ivan's fault.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I know. I'm not 
blaming him. I just... you know? <br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, er, 
Ivan's a cutie, I guess.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, he's like a 
cute little brother.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He's so sweet 
and adorable.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm. I guess.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, I 
think we've said all we can on the blond midget.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> There's a good 
reason why he has so many fans!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> FBM shall 
always prevail!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's Fans of 
a Blonde Midget, by the way.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay, shall we 
talk about Felix now?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix jumped 
off a lighthouse to save me. I owe my life to him.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My brother 
is rash, suicidal and a moron. -_-<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Well, he 
does seem rash and somewhat reckless, but I'm not sure he's a moron.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Of course 
not. I just like getting away with calling him names.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Where are 
you getting this suicidal thing from? I don't see it.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, he tried 
to pick a fight with Saturos and Menardi on the Venus Lighthouse.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It was to 
protect me though.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But a Level 
5 Venus Adept without any Djinn isn't going to last long against two powerful 
Mars Adepts.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No kidding. He 
would have been flattened in seconds if we hadn't turned up in time.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* But 
things turned out for the best, didn't they?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> He's definitely courageous 
to a fault, but he needs to think things through before acting on them.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Felix is so handsome and 
dashing. He's the best.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> 
Hehe. I think Sheba might have a bit of a crush on him.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32"> Can't say I get it, but he 
is my brother after all.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> Hmm. I... do look up to 
him. I'd like to just be by his side. Still, I don't know if... I'm still young.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Aww. Well, I'm 
definitely rooting for you. I wouldn't mind having you as a sister-in-law.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Thanks for your 
support. <br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Poor Felix has 
had it rough, hasn't he?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So much bad 
luck. Falling into that river...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He even jumped 
off a lighthouse.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then proceeded 
to get hit by a tidal wave.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And Agatio 
and Karst tried to kill Felix and Piers on Jupiter Lighthouse. Luckily, Sheba 
and I turned up to help.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Felix really 
deserves to catch a break.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I think he's 
just so handsome. *swoon* And that ponytail rocks.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It changes 
colour.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I swear I'll 
never understand that...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now let's talk 
about Piers.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Pow Pow 
Picard!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It just doesn't 
have the same ring if you use Piers, does it?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, it really 
doesn't.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wonder what 
most people today think about it. They have no idea where it came from.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not from this 
site, that's for sure. It's a rallying cry from the OBHL days.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh yeah, 
OBHL... wow, talking about these groups really brings it all back. By the way, 
I'm definitely a PGBHVA. That's a Psychotic Groupie of a Brown-Haired Venus 
Adept.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And OBHL is 
Obsessors of a Blue Haired Lemurian.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They all have 
blue hair, though.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> To be fair, the 
game wasn't even out in English yet...<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And a lot of 
people in the fandom were less than impressed with the English name. To the 
point of keeping the Japanese name in fanfics.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, Piers... 
well, I suppose there's not a lot to say.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Those 
muscles of his are impressive.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh yes, 
certainly. He has such large muscles!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He must work 
out a lot.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, possibly 
being a hundred or more, I suppose there was plenty of time for him to get 
jacked.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Just how old is 
he, I wonder...<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Good question. 
I wish I could read his mind and find out.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. But I 
guess it's impossible to read an Adept's mind without them knowing... which is 
probably a good thing.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32"> 
Because you'd hate me to catch you thinking romantic thoughts about Isaac, 
right?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I suppose 
there's no point in denying it.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Anyway, Piers was 
quite popular, wasn't he... The OBHL was quite large back in the day.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> The bigger two 
were definitely FBM and OBHL. PGBHVA was pretty much a minority.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Such a shame 
too. Felix deserves more love.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. Isaac 
seems to be way more popular... which I can understand, but I might be a bit 
biased...<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And the least 
popular is probably Garet, I suppose. Which is a shame. Garet's such a sweet and 
lovable man.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm. Is there 
anything else to talk about?<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Well, this is 
about guys... and Alex is a guy, I guess.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *hiss* I hate 
him. He's an evil jerk.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He was 
always kind of annoying and full of himself.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, he was 
just so self absorbed. It was annoying.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He betrayed my 
clan and didn't even apologise afterwards!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And he kept 
calling me dear!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He insulted 
us in Champa!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He also tried 
to steal Alchemy!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex also 
had the nerve to call me insensitive!<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And used 
Agatio and Karst to threaten us to light the lighthouse quicker!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Plus he 
tried to steal Piers's ship.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Clearly, he is 
rotten to the core.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... Are 
there any good things to say about him?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't 
think of anything.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Neither can I.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Even his 
cousin hasn't got anything good to say about him?!<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We were never 
friends. I knew he was evil from the start.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *reads Mia's 
mind* You're lying.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who said you 
could read my mind?!<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Whoah, whoah, 
time out. Now let's talk about... um...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> SATUROS!!!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're 
invading your page.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're 
girls too, so it's perfectly alright.<br>
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Heh... er... 
we have... no complaints.<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Go... right 
ahead.<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Y-yeah, do 
whatever you want.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Saturos... 
he's got some sort of smouldering sexiness about him.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hands off, 
he's too old for you. Plus, he's mine.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You're 
pretty possessive.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> A woman 
must learn to hold onto her man! He must not be allowed to get away!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I should be 
more like you, sis...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But not to 
Saturos. I shall never allow anybody else to get my Satty.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I 
understand. Saturos is a great and strong warrior. It's sad he had to be 
defeated.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Indeed. 
But we died nobly for our hometown!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I wish I 
could have seen the Fusion Dragon. It must have been an amazing sight.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *sigh* 
Saturos is so hot and sexy...<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Shall we 
talk about Agatio now?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is 
certainly not as good-looking as my Saturos.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *exaggerated 
sigh* Agatio's a good warrior, but... I think he's a bit too impetuous. Was it 
really a good idea to keep going when we were being outnumbered?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> When the 
odds are stacking up against you, it is important to keep fighting and overcome 
the odds! Learn from 
Agatio!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But, sis...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Proxians 
never run from a fight! They keep on going until they die! Or something.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He wanted us 
to fight Felix and the others right when they stopped us from killing Isaac and 
we were already tired...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My dear 
little sister, you still have much to learn. It is not stupidity, it is bravery.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Then, what 
Felix tried to pull on Venus Lighthouse was bravery?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No, <i>
that</i> was stupidity. He should have known he wasn't even a fair match for us.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> So... it was 
even okay for Agatio and I to keep fighting even when Jenna and Sheba came at 
Jupiter Lighthouse? Like he said?<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Agatio 
does not give up. You shouldn't either.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... okay. 
I guess I understand.<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You used to 
be fond of Felix, didn't you?<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wh-what? No 
way! He betrayed me when I was trying to avenge you! I've never liked him, never 
ever! Hmph!<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you still 
holding that against him? I mean, he did come through and save our hometown. <br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah, I suppose 
he did. And he did hold my hand back then...<br>
<img src="../icons/menardi.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We really 
should just put all our anger aside now, don't you think?<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Y-yeah. I 
just... I really hated Isaac after learning that he'd sent you to your deaths. I 
was blinded by rage... <br>
