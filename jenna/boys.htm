<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's our 
turn! We'll be saying stuff about the girls.<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> They won't 
know what we're saying, will they?<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We should 
just take care what we say.<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah... 
because the girls can be scary.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'm sure it 
will be fine.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I bet nothing 
nice was said about me.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Gee, I can't imagine why. Maybe you shouldn't have attempted to use us to claim 
ultimate power.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Ahem. 
This is about the girls, not us.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Yeah... haha, truth be 
told, I'm a bit nervous. Hey, Felix isn't gonna kill us if we say the wrong 
thing about Jenna, is he?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> ...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Just choose your words 
wisely.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Alright, let's 
start this off with talking about Mia.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Wait, what? Are you 
putting Jenna off on purpose?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Relax, Felix, I'm sure 
there's no ill intentions there...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Ahem. Mia's quite the 
beauty. She's sweet and kind.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> With a bit of a sarcastic 
streak too.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Umm... to 
be honest...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Yes? No 
need to hold back.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
She's beautiful. I think she's like an angel... but at the same time... there 
are moments when she's even scarier than Jenna.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> I was going to object to 
my sister being called scary, but... well. Maybe you do kind of have a point.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Haha, yes. Mia does have 
her unexpected moments. But she's very sweet and kind.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> She was taking care of the 
people of her village before the lighthouse was lit, wasn't she?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Yes, she's always looking 
out for people. We really are very lucky to have her.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Mia certainly can hold a 
grudge though.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Well, 
she was very hurt by Alex's actions. I can't imagine how she must have felt.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Yes, poor Mia. It's really 
no wonder she's quite bitter.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> That one moment of being 
sarcastic was really something. Remember, in the cave?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Yes, it was, wasn't it?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> Ahh. Mia...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Oh, you decided to join 
us?<br><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> What a quiet, sweet 
and kind girl she is. Oh, and she's my cousin, you know.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Well, that was a surprise.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> We probably should have 
figured, but...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Yeah, 
how come it never even came up? I know Alex is an enigma, but this is 
ridiculous.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Right? A 
heads up wouldn't have hurt...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> Well, I'm sorry. I wasn't 
aware I was supposed to detail all my familial relations. Why don't you ask Mia 
why she never told you then?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> And I'm sure many of us 
were under the impression you were harbouring a crush on Mia.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> Was I giving off that 
impression?<br><img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Well, kind 
of, yes.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alright, let's 
move on. Hmm, how about Jenna...<br>
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Scary.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Violent.<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Can make 
witty one-liners.<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She's quite 
positive and upbeat. I like her personality.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Eh... if you don't annoy 
her, she isn't too bad.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I seem to be 
remarkably good at annoying her. But then again I annoy everybody apparently.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Well, yeah. I'm surprised 
she never set you on fire.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Jenna... she did alright, 
didn't she? You know...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> 
You mean, during those three years?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Of course it was hard for 
her. <br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> My dad was gone, 
but I still had my mother. Jenna... I couldn't even imagine how it felt.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> You had to be there for 
your mother as well. We did what we could for her.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> And she had her 
grandparents and aunt too. Jenna was sad for a very long time...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> But we never left her 
side. Jenna was never alone.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Thank goodness for that. I 
can't tell you how much we worried about her those three years, but at least we 
were aware she was safe at home. I just wish...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> There was nothing you 
could have done, Felix. You were stuck miles away from home.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> At least you were all able 
to come together again.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
Dear me. Such a serious turn of conversation...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Well... I suppose we may 
as well talk about Sheba now.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Sheba, huh. Man, you know, 
Lord Babi really was kind of an asshole, kidnapping her.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Yep, just so that he could 
build a tower to go find Lemurian draught.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> And had he come back for 
more, I assure you we would not have welcomed him with open arms.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> You know, you're right. 
Babi really was an asshole.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Poor Sheba, taken from her 
home and held hostage... how horrible.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> What were we thinking?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Still, we got the ship out 
of it. The ship that was never heard of ever again.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Anyway, Sheba is a good 
kid.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Is she?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Whatever do you mean?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> I heard she flat out told 
Karst we were the ones who killed Saturos and Menardi.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> I'm sure she just said it 
without thinking. Let's not hold it against her.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Haha. Yeah. Maybe that was 
a bit... tactless and dangerous, but it was all fine in the end. Besides, Karst 
wasn't the only one coming after me...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Fame comes with its 
downsides, doesn't it? Anyway, Sheba may be a bit blunt and outspoken, but she's 
not a bad person.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Yes, 
let's not be too hard on her, now. And she has good opinions now and then. Such 
as classic lines about the Alhafran Mayor...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> I've heard he's an 
unpleasant guy.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Utterly 
odious, and Sheba was quite right in pointing out what an nasty character he 
was.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Eh, maybe she's 
not so bad after all...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32"> 
I can't say I have much of an opinion on her myself. <br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Anyway, we should just let 
bygones be bygones. <br><img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> She 
didn't even get mentioned in the third game.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Just in the Sun Saga, 
right?<br><img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Yes. So I feel 
sorry for her.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Sheba 
deserved better. And honestly, I think I did too, but that's a subject for 
elsewhere...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> So...<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's our 
turn! I'm invading to speak of Menardi!<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I'll join 
in too!<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You kids 
keep quiet while we discuss the beautiful women of Prox.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Okay?<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I am not a 
kid- *punched* Ow. That hurt. ._.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ahh, 
Menardi. She is truly a beauty.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I like 
those shiny red scales.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Such 
radiant, blonde hair...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Her skin's 
a nice shade of pink too.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And those 
fingernails! Those beautiful crimson eyes! She is a beauty!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> And she's got radiant 
blonde hair... do we not have anything to say other than about her appearance?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Her personality? Which 
is basically just angry.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Seems like an 
issue for all of us to be honest.<br>
<img src="../icons/saturos.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> You know, you 
do have a good point...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Hmm. Well, I 
guess that's the downside of being in the antagonist role.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> To be fair, we were on a 
pretty stressful mission.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> I wasn't too familiar 
with Menardi. What else can you say about her?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> She's an incredible 
woman, very determined, and she really cares for her little sister. To be 
honest, Menardi hoped we'd be able to shoulder the entire burden and Karst 
wouldn't have to get caught up in all this...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> But, unfortunately, we 
had no choice to... and we paid the price for it.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> So, Karst... well, I 
just remember her as Menardi's mouthy kid sister.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> Karst really looked up to 
Menardi. She was devastated to hear about her death.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> Can't say I blame her 
for going on a roaring rampage of revenge.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> It's fortunate Prox was 
able to be saved in the end. If only we could all have lived to see it...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> if only we could have 
lived to come back home and those sisters could have reunited. <br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> A pity, indeed.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> I think Karst was 
actually quite fond of you, Felix.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Uh... she was?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> Come to think of it, we 
haven't heard much of your time in Prox.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Were you chatting up the 
girls in Prox, then?<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
It... it wasn't like that!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> I'm sure I remember at 
least one woman saying you were hot...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> I... look, okay, maybe 
Karst and I talked a few times, but it was no big deal.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> Perhaps you meant more to 
her than she thought. Imagine how it felt when you saved the person who killed 
her sister.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> You are a 
cruel man, Felix.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Oh, 
come on! She was trying to kill me!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> Yeah, like Felix was just 
gonna let us all die...<br><img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> 
Honestly, I am sorry that circumstances had to play out the way they did...<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32"> We did what we had to do. 
You Proxians are far too angry and violent for your own good.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> So, what was Karst like 
when... not murdery and vengeful?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32"> Hmm. She certainly had a 
spark. She wasn't afraid to speak her thoughts. And she was quite caring. It 
really was different back in Prox... and even Menardi was a bit nicer. Still 
pretty scary, though. She was quite harsh. But, really, who can blame her... 
everyone was terrified of that rift swallowing them up.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Well, I think we've said 
all that we can.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> 
Yeah... well, that didn't go too badly, huh.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Now I wonder what they said 
about us...<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not sure I 
really want to know what they said about me...<br>
