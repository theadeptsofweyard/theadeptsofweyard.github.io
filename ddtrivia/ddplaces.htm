<p class="style1">Weyard/Earth comparison</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />So it 
seems Weyard has some connections to Earth and that's what this page is about.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" />Just 
like in the first two games, the place names come from real world places.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />And of course a 
lot of them in this game are also, well... messed up.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> A pity, really. 
Fortunately we have people willing to do the research and expose the amazing 
research Camelot put into these games.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" />It really is quite 
impressive.<br />
<img alt="" height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> A shame, I must 
say, to erase all that brilliant insight into this other world upon which ours 
is based.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" />Yeah. It's quite 
fascinating, for sure.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" />Go ahead and take a 
look, I'm sure you'll find it interesting.</p>
