<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32"> Weyard 
actually has a lot of parallels with the real world. Unfortunately, a lot of 
references were lost in translation.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32"> So 
basically we've done the research and uncovered these references. If you want to 
know more about the parallels between Weyard and Earth, this is the page for 
you.<br><img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32"> We 
hope you'll find it an interesting read. It sure is a shame the translators 
couldn't keep these references intact.<br>
<img border="0" height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32"> Of course, 
we do appreciate the trouble the translators went to to bring us the game in 
other languages, but sometimes stuff they do... just doesn't make sense.</p>
