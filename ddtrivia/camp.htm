<p class="style1">Carver&#39;s Camp</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2"><img height="32" src="../icons/tyrell.png" width="32" /> 
Wasn't this the place with the breaking down gondolas?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Yes, it was quite a 
dangerous place, wasn't it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> We never did find out 
what happened after getting Carver across that gap...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karis.png" width="32" /> Speaking of that gap... 
you can get across it by cheating.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/rief.png" width="32" /> And of course that's what 
this page is about.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/matthew.png" width="32" /> Just imagine if we 
could have gone to Bilibin...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> So curious indeed. Makes 
you wonder what could have been.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> I'd rather have ended 
up in Bilibin than Morgal, that's for sure!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sveta.png" width="32" /> I really am so sorry 
about that...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/amiti.png" width="32" /> It's almost like being a 
pirate is a bad idea. Who would have thought.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/eoleodd.png" width="32" /> Yeah, well, taking 
risks is just all part and parcel of being a pirate. Yo-ho~<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/himi.png" width="32" /> Do you really have no 
choice...?</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp1.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">So, here we are on the other side of the broken bridge. I 
guess we can get to Bilibin now! Actually, no, we can&#39;t...</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp2.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Notice how there&#39;s no green marker on the house on the map to 
tell you it&#39;s an entrance? Well, I suppose that would mean you can&#39;t enter the 
house...</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp3.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Except you actually can go inside it. They have even gone to 
the trouble of furnishing this house. Isn&#39;t that nice? Still, it&#39;s a building 
normally inaccessible through gameplay, so I guess you wouldn&#39;t be able to find 
anything in a house like this, right?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp4.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Oh, except for a lucky pepper. Nice to know that the game 
designers still tend to not think things through. So, yeah, there&#39;s a lucky 
pepper in the game you can never get (without cheating). Eh, it&#39;s only a lucky 
pepper anyway.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp5.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Eh?! Apparently ovens are capable of translating now?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp6.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">And so are cupboards, it seems. Well, I guess we don&#39;t need 
humans to translate anymore. Let&#39;s just teach our ovens and cupboards how to 
translate. Yay~!</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp7.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">This log here can be rolled from the side of the house to that 
ledge next to the Psynergy Vortex. You can use the log to hop onto those ledges 
to the north, but there&#39;s nothing there. Kinda strange they put that ledge and 
log there, not to mention the Lucky Pepper inside the furnished house you can 
enter... maybe this area was originally going to be accessible.</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp9.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Matthew&#39;s had enough, so why don&#39;t we try and leave from this 
side now?</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp10.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Matthew very briefly reappears on the world map...</p>
<p class="style2"><img src="camp/camp11.png" width="256" height="384" /></p>
<p class="style2">Only to end up back inside Carver&#39;s Camp. Okay then.</p>
