	Golden Sun 4-Koma (Raw)<br>
	<br>
	This is the Golden Sun 4-Koma Gag Battle manga, which was published in 2001. 
	It&#39;s a collection of comedic 4-cell comics drawn by different artists.
	The comic is no longer in print. It only covers the first game and they 
	never did make one for The Lost Age. 
	<br>

	There is a complete translation of the Golden Sun 4-Koma available at the

	Golden Sun Dark Dawn V-Jump Manga (Scanslated)<br>
	<br>
	This is a short comic that covers the opening sequence of Golden Sun: Dark 
	Dawn, and it was published in V-Jump magazine, as well as the Golden Sun: 
	Dark Dawn 
	Adepts&#39; Navigation Guide. Unfortunately, it was only a one-shot and we never 
	did get any more than just this. Well, better than nothing.<br>

	This scanslation was provided by a member of the Golden Sun Realm forums. 
	Since the forums no longer exist, I am unable to get exact credit. Just know 
	I neither scanned nor translated this.<br>
