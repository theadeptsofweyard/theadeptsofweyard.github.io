<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh. I'm tied 
to a chair. Great. Just great.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> It's 
torture time, Alex.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
ready?<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> No.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Too bad. 
We're doing it anyway.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We're going 
to make you wish you'd never been born.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... How?<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> See, we got 
everyone to say some words on how they feel about you.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> We haven't 
listened to them yet, but we're sure they will make you suffer and want to die.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Uh... okay. 
I'm confused though.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Never mind, 
you'll understand soon enough.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now let's 
hear them. *pushes play button on recorder*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is just 
so pathetic. He is not capable of loving anybody, except for himself, and is a 
complete narcissist, which is why he spends all morning making his hair look 
absolutely perfect, like anybody even cares. He probably kisses the mirror as 
well. The only reason he claims to be in love with Mia is because she looks 
similar to him. Uh huh. Alex only cares about himself. What a complete loser.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/garet.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I WOULD JUST 
LIKE TO SAY THAT ALEX IS A PRUDE LOSER. HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO FRIENDS. HE ONLY 
ATTEMPTS TO STEAL ALCHEMY BECAUSE THATS WHAT HE KNOWS BEST BY FAR. AT THIS POINT 
IN HIS LIFE, HE IDOLIZES HIS MOTHER BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS 
WILLING TO KISS HIM. OTHER THAN HIS MOTHER HE HAS NEVER EVER TOUCHED A GIRL NOR 
WOULD HE EVER TRY BECAUSE HE IS SO SCARED. INSTEAND, HE SITS AT HOME ALL DAY IN 
A BIG BLACK COUSHY CHAIR ON HIS MOST LIKELY OBESE ASS, EATING A TUB OF POPCORN 
WITH TONS OF BUTTER AND SALT, AND DRINKING DIET DOCTER PEPPER OUT OF A BIG SLURP 
CONTAINER. HE MOST LIKELY HAS GREASE STAINS ON HIS SHIRT AND SKID MARKS IN HIS 
TIGHTY-WHITIES. HIS WHOLE LIFE REVOLVES AROUND MANIPULATING PEOPLE AND HE THINKS 
HE'S SO GREAT JUST BECAUSE HE GOT A COUPLE ONLINE AWARDS THAT DONT MEAN SHIT. HE 
MAKES A LIVING BY SELLING HIS RUNESCAPE ACCOUNT ON EBAY AND THE ONLY WAY HE 
COULD EVER HOPE TO GET MARRIED OR EVEN TALK TO A HUMAN OF THE OPPOSITE SEX WOULD 
BE ON SOME STUPID ONLINE GAME LIKE EVERQUEST. HE WEARS GIANT, THICK, BIG BLACK 
GLASSES AND HE HASNT SHOWERED IN TWO WEEKS. HE HAS A BEARD BECAUSE HE IS TOO 
LAZY TO SHAVE IT AND HE HASNT CHANGED HIS UNDERWEAR IN MONTHS. HE LIKES CAUSING 
HARM TO PEOPLE TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIS OWN PITIFUL LIFE. HE IS A LOSER 
AND THATS ALL HE WILL BE!!</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... gosh... 
I'm not very good at insults. Okay, er, I think Alex really looks like a girl. 
Maybe he used to be a girl and had a sex change operation? I keep thinking he 
looks like a girl. Alex might be short for Alexis or Alexandra, you know? I 
wouldn't be surprised. I bet it's because of his hair... why is he so obsessed 
with it anyway? I don't see the big deal... what, you want me to shut up now? 
Aww... wait! Maybe I can think of a better insult! Um... er... forget it.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> He is EVIL!!! 
Alex is the EVILEST PERSON in all of Weyard! He is so disgustingly evil that I 
hate him so much and I hope he died when Mt. Aleph sank into the ground. It sure 
would serve him right. What a scumbag he is. I utterly despise him with every 
fiber of my being. In fact, he is the only person I am actually capable of 
wishing dead.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *is sobbing 
wretchedly* Everybody hates me... ;_;</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is 
totally full of it. He thinks that he's so great. Well, he isn't. He's creepy 
and stuff, and I just don't like him at all, and I hope he stays away from my 
sister. There's no way I want that thing in my family, not ever. Perish the 
thought...</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um, you want 
to know what I think of Alex? Well, for one thing, I think he's kind of hot and-</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is so 
in love with himself, I bet he wishes to clone himself and have sex with his 
clone. The only other person he loves in the world is his mommy. He is a lying, 
conniving, cheating, manipulative dirtbag who used us all and I hope he suffers.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex called 
me an amateur Water Adept once, but he is the true amateur. Does he have hordes 
of raving fangirls and an awesome catchphrase? Nope. Clearly, I am far more 
popular than he is. Does Alex even have fangirls? I think even Garet is more 
popular than Alex is, and considering that Garet isn't even all that popular, 
that's pretty amazing. And most people who want Alex to be alive in the third 
game only want him to be alive so that he can be a boss and they can beat him 
up! Pretty pathetic, isn't it?</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's it! I 
can't take anymore of this!!! *bites off tongue and chokes to death on blood*</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh, look at 
that. He actually killed himself.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What a 
fitting end to his piss poor existence indeed.</p>
