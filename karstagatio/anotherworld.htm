<p><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Hmm? For some reason, 
I sense a foreboding presence. Whatever could it be?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> Hello, Alex.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> Fancy that we should 
happen to cross paths. What a coincidence.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Agatio. Karst. It's been 
a while.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> It certainly has, hasn't 
it?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> Can be hard thinking of 
new ideas for tortures, you know?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> Luckily for you, we've 
got a new torture method.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> I'm sure you must be 
quivering with excitement just thinking about it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Sigh. Is there any point 
in me attempting to escape?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> I think you already 
know the answer to that.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> It's time to suffer! 
Ahahahahahahahaha!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Ugh. I'm getting too old 
for this.</p>
<p>*Karst and Agatio grab Alex and drag him off. They take him to a glowing 
portal.*</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Er... what is this 
supposed to be?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> It's a portal, duh.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> Yup, a portal to 
someplace else.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> So we're just gonna 
like, throw you through.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Eh? Aren't you coming?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> No, of course not.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> What? Just what kind of 
place is beyond that portal?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> Oh, you'll see. Heh heh 
heh. Have fun, Alex.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Nooooooooooo!</p>
<p>*Alex struggles but is powerless to stop them from throwing him through the 
portal.*</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> AAAAHHHHH *hits 
ground* ... Huh? What the? I thought I was going to be thrown into fiery pits or 
something. Why am I in a village? Maybe they messed up. Yeah, that must be it. 
Heh heh... those fools. So, which village is this again? Might as well take a 
look around. Not like I have anything better to do. Sure beats being torture, 
yup.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Hey, Alex!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Dammit! I should have 
just turned around and left. Oh well, just play it cool. Maybe they won't attack 
me right away.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Where did you get to? We 
were wondering where you went.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh. What? Isn't it 
strange that I'm even here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Of course not, you live 
here, don't you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ... Live... here? Are you 
out of your minds? Why would I live here? And why are you people here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Well, that's a nice way to 
talk to us after we decided to let bygones be bygones. Mind you, I know you're 
still an evil jerk. I'm watching you, Alex! You're evil! EVIL!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Now, now, Mia, didn't we 
decide to accept he'd turned over a new leaf?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> I didn't! *clenches 
fist* I want nothing more to pound that jerk's face in and make him wish he'd 
never been... *kicks rock* Huh? What's this? *picks up rock and bonks head with 
it* Ow. Garet hit head. Head hurty. <br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Garet, how could you say 
something so terrible? Apologise to Alex at once or I will set you on fire!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> ... You know he's also a 
Fire Adept, right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Of course I know that!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Uuugh... now Jenna's mad 
at me... fine. Sorry. Am I forgiven, Jenna?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> I guess so?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Phew. I guess I still 
have a chance after all.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Ahem. I hope you weren't 
talking about having a chance with my little sister just now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Maybe I was. What's it 
to you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> OVER MY DEAD BODY WILL 
YOU EVER DATE JENNA! *pulls out sword*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> AAAHHHHHH *runs* 
HEEELLLLPPPP! Felix's trying to kill me again!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Sigh. Not this shit 
again.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> What have I walked into?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> I don't know what you 
mean, this kind of stuff happens every day. Yup. Every day.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Yeah. I don't know why 
you seem so confused. It's totally normal.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> For that matter, why are 
you all treating me like I'm your friend?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Er. Aren't you? I 
thought we had agreed to put your attempts at world domination aside and get 
along.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Lies! He's obviously using 
us all and will stab us in the back given a chance!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> This is really strange... 
just where am I?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Vale, of course.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh, didn't Vale sink?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Yes. We rebuilt it. Did 
you hit your head or something?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Could he have got 
amnesia?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> If it's a result of 
hitting his head, I would be VERY happy to try and undo it. *grins evilly and 
holds mace*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Uhh, I really don't 
think that's going to do any good.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> HEEEEEELLLLLLP!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Oh, for Iris's sake! 
*stomps away* Felix! Leave Garet alone and stop trying to kill him, or I swear I 
will burn you! Can you stop being ridiculously overprotective for five freaking 
minutes?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> You know, I think I 
really am starting to feel tortured...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Yes, it's so 
frustrating. Felix can't stand it when guys even show the slightest hint of 
interest in Jenna. Especially Garet. Honestly, is it such a bad idea if they 
find love together? I found love with Mia and it was the most wonderful thing to 
ever happen to me.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Isaac, it's so sweet 
of you to say something like that. I, too, am so glad that we were able to meet. 
Indeed, it must have been fate that we crossed paths. We are without a doubt 
soulmates who were always intended to meet.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Yes, I think so too, 
Mia. Our fates were no doubt written in the stars. I love you more than 
anything, my sweet angel.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Nothing makes me happier 
than to hear that from you, my golden haired knight.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Mia.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Isaac.</p>
<p>*Isaac and Mia proceed to kiss passionately*</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Barf.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> That's not a very nice 
thing to say, Alex. We should be happy for them. Isn't it sweet how in love they 
are?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yes. Love seems 
incredible. Actually... Ivan, I love you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> You... you do?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yes, I suddenly realised 
that I was in love with you just now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *eyeroll* Oh come on, 
that's the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Sheba... I too have had 
feelings for you for a long time now but I was too shy to admit it.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Ivan! You really do 
love me! I'm so glad!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Please. You're pulling my 
leg, aren't you?</p>
<p>*Ivan and Sheba start kissing*</p>
<p><img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Oh, come on.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Well. Now I'm feeling 
left out.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> If you start claiming to 
have feelings for me, I'm going to introduce you to the pointy end of my swo... 
ugh.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Huh?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Nothing! I did not say 
anything that could be taken as innuendo just now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Oookaaay...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *looks over at Garet and 
Jenna* What, now even they are kissing?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> ARGLEHFYSNGRAAAAAAAH! 
I'LL KILL YOU, GA- *is suddenly on fire*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Shut up, Felix! Now 
then, Garet, my sweet, precious snugglebunny, just where were we?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> *stomach rumbles* Umm... 
about to get lunch?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Haha! No, silly! *kisses 
Garet*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Okay, why is Felix acting 
like a demented siscon? Is he actually incestuous or something?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Haha, no, that's just 
how he's always been. It's totally normal.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, isn't it like the 
duty of every brother to ensure his little sister remains a forever virgin?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> No, it's not!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> You know, Alex, I know 
we're just cousins... but... like, we're so close, we're practically siblings, 
right? Could I... call you Onii-chan?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> ...! Um... I... no! No, 
absolutely not! And besides, didn't you want me dead a moment ago?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> Oh yeah! DIE, ALEX!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Some things will never 
change, huh?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Haha, yeah. <br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Pieeeeers! Heeeeeelp! 
*is rolling on ground, still ablaze*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Sigh. Alright, alright, 
I'm coming. *proceeds to go douse Felix and heals him*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Gasp... gasp... I 
thought I was going to die...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> There, there, Felix, 
it's okay now. *holds and pats head*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> You saved me, Piers. ;_; 
I'm so grateful to you... <br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Oh, Felix, I'm only 
doing what a good friend would.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> No... Piers... to me, 
you're much more than a friend...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> *gasp* Y-you really feel 
that way about me?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> *nods*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I... I feel the same 
way, Felix! I've just been too afraid to say it all this time...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *watches them kiss* Hmph. 
What does he even see in that amateur Water Adept anyway? Stupid, sexy Felix...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Did you say something 
just now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Uh...! No, you were just 
hearing things, that's all.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> KEKEKEKEKEKEKE!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> GAHAHAHA!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> ... Tch, I wanted to 
kiss him first. *glares daggers at Piers*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> What are you talking 
about, Karst? We're EVIL, remember? And they aren't.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> *pout* But Felix is 
hot... even if he's a dirty traitor...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Aaaaaah!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> It's them! Saturos, 
Menardi, Agatio and Karst!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Aren't they supposed to 
be dead?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Are you up to no good 
again!?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Whatever you're 
planning, we'll definitely stop you!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, I'm not afraid of 
you evil assholes!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> I'm just going to smile 
and nod and pretend like I understand what's going on.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> Oh, we were brought 
back from the dead by a necromancer.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> And now we're back 
for...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> Revenge!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> And because we like 
being evil and stuff!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Evil? I thought you all 
just wanted to save your hometown?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, well, that's all 
old news. It's saved now, who cares.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> And now we gotta act 
evil, because, uhhh... why are we acting evil again?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> Because we want power 
and stuff! Power is awesome!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> I JUST WANT TO DATE 
FELIX! LET ME DATE HIM!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Umm... aren't I the one 
you should be asking?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> DATE ME OR I'LL KILL 
YOU!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> Hahaha, isn't my 
little sister just so cute?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> Um. Yeah. *sets a tree 
on fire* Take that, tree!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> My, isn't it just a 
fine day, today?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/isaac.gif" width="32" /> Oh no, it's Kraden!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/garet.gif" width="32" /> Ugh, of all the people 
to show up...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/ivan.gif" width="32" /> Everything's just going 
from bad to worse!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/mia.gif" width="32" /> He's going to start 
talking! We're doomed!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *laughs nervously* Aren't 
you all overreacting just a little?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Oh, the horror! *clings 
to Piers*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/piers.gif" width="32" /> Not him! Anyone but him!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> Today, I was partaking 
in my daily walk around Vale and I just happened to see a trio of puppies 
playing. Now, as you all know, it is impossible to walk past playing puppies so 
I was forced to turn around and seek out another-<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/jenna.gif" width="32" /> Nobody cares! Shut your 
trap, Kraden!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/sheba.gif" width="32" /> Yeah, you're such an 
annoying old man!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" /> Tch. A formidable foe 
has suddenly appeared.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" /> It seems we have no 
choice but to retreat for now.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> Are you serious?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" /> Mark our words though, 
we'll be back! Just you wait, Felix!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/felix.gif" width="32" /> Oh, hell. Have I got a 
stalker now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" /> This is not the last 
you've seen of us!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" /> *watches them run* Take 
me with you!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/kraden.gif" width="32" /> Garm is the Sacred Twin 
black axe of Grado. Garm is S-Ranked, meaning a unit must have an S-Rank in axes 
to use it. Due to the fact that a unit can only one S-Rank, a, say, a Warrior 
must choose between S-Ranking Bows or S-Ranking Axes. However, I slightly lied. 
Lyon can S-Rank both Dark Magic and Staves. In Fire Emblem 6: Fuuin no Tsurugi, 
a unit can S-Rank all possible weapons it can use. Therefore, a FE6 unit, to be 
specific, a FE6 Paladin, the best of which is Zealot, could use Garm, Audhulma, 
and Vidofnir. I'm sorry, I slightly lied again. A FE6 unit could not use Fire 
Emblem 8: The Sacred Stones weapons. However, it can use FE6 weapons. Therefore, 
it can use the Armads, Durandal, and Malte. However, it can not use all three at 
once, unless the game has been significantly altered and the Paladin has three 
arms. <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><br />
