Now, we have a lot of reasons to hate Alex, and why we want to torture him.

DID YOU SAY SOMETHING, AGATIO?

Eeep... no, course not!

Now, let the reasons why Alex must be hated roll! Drumroll please!
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>Golden Sun</b><b></b>
</p><p>Alex didn't get as much screentime, save for Mercury Lighthouse, but he 
still manages to be annoying. Let's see... we'll start in Sol Sanctum of course.</p><p>
Ok, he wasn't that bad yet. Let's move to Mercury Lighthouse. Wow, he only gets 
two scenes in the game, not counting after the credits on Idejima.</p><p>Anyway, 
of course, Alex acts like the smug jerk that he is. Alex shows absolutely no 
remorse for hurting Mia's feelings/betraying the clan and he doesn't even seem 
to care how she feels either. Alex also buys time until Saturos gets up which, 
as Mia says,&nbsp; is not fair, right?</p><p>Alex insults Isaac and co. by 
saying he doubts they are the type to &quot;finish&quot; anyone off. I think that's an 
insult...</p><p><b>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Okay, we start with Venus Lighthouse, naturally. Hmm, Alex pisses Jenna 
off a bit, but he does apologise in a roundabout way so we'll let that slide.</p><p>
Let's see... Alex is funny in the scene with the soldiers/men, but quite 
arrogant in tone, which I suppose some people wouldn't like. I still find it 
funny though.
</p><p>And then, on Idejima, after the tidal wave hits, he runs off and leaves 
Felix, Jenna, Sheba and Kraden unconscious on Idejima. How mean... he could at 
least have made sure that they were okay, but he probably just ran off without 
another thought. The next time you can see him, in Daila, he's naturally 
self-absorbed. Oddly enough, the issue of being left for dead doesn't really 
come up until Champa. I don't know why it isn't even mentioned in Daila or 
Alhafra. Anyway, he doesn't want to travel with them when asked in Daila. What 
does he have against Felix and co. anyway?</p><p>In Alhafra, at first, Alex 
refuses to let you read his mind. Sneaky guy. Though, later on, he does let 
you... but he's definitely got something to hide.</p><p>Well, Champa definitely 
takes the cake for Alex being at his most annoying, in my opinion. Alex insults 
Agatio and Karst and also goes on to insult Saturos and Menardi. Alex referred 
to them as simple buffoons incapable of logic and intelligence or something 
similar, but considering how exactly S, M, A and K ended up, it leads you to 
wonder whether Alex was right... *bricked* Ouchies! Look, just because you 
forced me into this, doesn't mean I can't insult you! And I have scary 
webmistress powers! MWAHAHAHAHA!
</p><p>Alex also insults Felix-tachi, annoyingly enough. He calls Piers an 
&quot;amateur water Adept&quot; and Felix and the others &quot;useless&quot; and goes on to say that 
was why he finally had to abandon them. Alex also admits he actually planned to 
steal Piers's ship! Alex also talks about himself way too much, annoyingly 
enough. Not only that, but Alex is actually USING Agatio and Karst to scare 
Felix's group into lighting Juputer Lighthouse sooner! Incentive, my ass.</p><p>
I also feel that Alex talks way too much. Research of the Champa scene shows 
that Alex seemed to have talked more than Kraden. We leave you to ponder on this 
speculation.
</p><p>Confusingly enough, Alex acts differently on Jupiter Lighthouse. Not 
helping Agatio and Karst, healing Felix's party... yeah, I don't understand it. 
But he's not always that nice. If, on Jupiter Lighthouse's aerie, you let Agatio 
and Karst beat you, Alex doesn't bother to help, he just runs off with Agatio 
and Karst, leaving everyone for dead. Aww. Quite strangely, the other way 
around, he HEALS Agatio and Karst, even after all that hard work. I really don't 
understand that guy... though, he does stop them from harming Felix and the 
others further...</p><p>Okay, the next time we see him is on Mt. Aleph... when 
he sensationally tries to summon storms on Vale, and proceeds to have a whining 
fit when the Wise One tells him he got owned and owns him again. With any luck, 
he got buried under a ton of rocks. Oh yeah, and the main thing is, Alex was 
trying to steal Alchemy!<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>So, there you go! That's why Alex must be tortured... painfully!<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><img src="../icons/mia.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
DIE! DIE!
<br><img src="../icons/isaac.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Please calm down a little, Mia...<br><img src="../icons/jenna.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Oh come on! You lot are so unfair!
<br><img src="../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
If all this has not managed to convince you...
<br><img src="../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
We're worried for your sanity...
<br><img src="../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
You must resist his bishonen looks!
<br><img src="../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Unite and show dislike for Alex!
