Ahahahahahaha...
<br><img src="../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Ehehehehehehe...
<br><img src="../icons/agatio.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
You should never have come...
<br><img src="../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Now you will never leave...
<br><img src="../icons/menardi.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Huh, I'm so sure you've got them scared... not...
<br><img src="../icons/saturos.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
You have a long way to go before you learn how to properly scare people!
<br><img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32"> Oh, I think I'm plenty 
scary enough with my scythe. Well, Menardi? Am I scary?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> You are doing a fine 
job, my little sister.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> 
You have arrived... at the Torture Chamber!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32"> Now quiver in fear!<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> You know you're not 
actually torturing the site visitors, right?<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> Yeah, we need them to 
believe we're really very nice people who only menace people who deserve it.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32"> Well, this one definitely 
deserves it!<br><img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> After 
all, this is where we're going to torture a certain annoying Adept.<br><img src="../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
Want to see a certain Mercury Adept named Alex die a slow, painful death?
<br><img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32"> Sure, why not. He 
was an obnoxious guy.<br><img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32"> 
I guess he was useful once or twice, but, yeah, his attitude was grating.<br>
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32"> If that is how you feel, 
then this is the place for you! Alex will pay for the things he has done!<br><img src="../icons/karst.gif" nosave="" height="32" width="32"> 
We're going to do lots of terrible things to him, and when we've done something 
new, we'll put it up!
