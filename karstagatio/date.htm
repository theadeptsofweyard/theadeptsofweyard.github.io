I have a bad feeling about this... I smell danger.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" />  How very perceptive of you.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Yikes!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" />  Hello there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  What are you up to now, you demons?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" />  Demons? What kind of name is that for your friends? I'm seriously hurt.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  ... You're kidding me, right?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" />  We've got a surprise for you. ^_^<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Oh, hell, no! *tries to warp* Wait, what?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" />  Kyarorain gave us this anti-Psynergy device. Adepts within fifty metres 
of it can't use Psynergy.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Nooooo! *tries to run*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" />  *clubs Alex over head*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  x_x<br />
<br />
**Alex wakes up to find himself tied to a chair**<br />
<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Oog... my head... where am I?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Hello there.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  You! Why are you here?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Hmph, you're so rude. And I even went to the trouble of dressing you 
up.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Uhh... *looks at himself* Why the hell am I wearing a dress?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  It looks so good on you. ^_^ I picked it out myself.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  It's gross! It's all pink and flowery! And what's with the frills and 
ribbons?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Are you saying I have bad taste in fashion? *conjures fireball*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  ... And the anti-Psynergy thing is apparently gone. Figures. Uh, I mean, 
your taste in fashion is impeccable!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Why, thank you. ^_^&nbsp;<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  If this is supposed to be my torture, this is just dumb.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  I know, I know. No man should feel bad about wearing women's clothes. 
The torture's coming up later.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  ... Hey, you didn't look at anything, did you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Whatever do you mean? *twirls hair and looks innocent*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  *glares*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Oh, I'm sorry, was I not supposed to?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  You...!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  I must say, you're smaller than I expected.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  ............... *grinds teeth*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Now then, let's put some makeup on, shall we?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Hell, no! *writhes in chair*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  But I want to put makeup on!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  I don't want any!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Would you like me to burn off your teeny tiny little dick? ^_________^<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  ... I'll behave. And stop insulting my penis please. When did this site 
get to the point of making cracks about dicks anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  The site went to hell a long time ago. Now then... *applies makeup* All 
done!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Sigh. How come you're here anyway? Where are Agatio and Karst?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Well, Saturos and I wanted to have a go for a change. Saturos is 
currently entertaining our guest, aka your date.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Date?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Hey, Menardi, is he ready yet? The guest is getting impatient and I 
can't stand listening to him much longer.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Yes, all done! ^_^<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Excuse me, maybe there's something wrong with my hearing, but did you use 
the male pronoun just now?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Yes. Your date is male.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Oh, please. Have we really stooped to homosexuality as a torture?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  You misunderstand, Alex. It's not about the guest being a man. It's WHO 
he is. *laughs evilly*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Yeah. There aren't a lot of obnoxious women, and let's face it, Lady 
McCoy is pretty good looking so...<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  *whimpers*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Come in!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  it's about time. I have been waiting for an inexcusably long time! I hope 
you will compensate me for this!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  No. NO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Have fun, Alex!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Enjoy your date!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  YOU BASTAAAAAAAAARDS!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  Oooh, what a pretty young thing!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  I'LL KILL YOU ALL!!!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  Oh, please stop yelling. *sits down next to Alex* It hurts my ears.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Get away from me, you ugly son of a bitch!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  What a foul mouthed lady. I am shocked. Shocked!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  I'm a man, you goddamn sack of crap!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  Oh, are you?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Yes, so will you please leave me alone?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  Eh, I don't particularly mind.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Look, who would ever want to date an 
obnoxious prick like you?!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  My, such rudeness! How inappropriate! If we were in Alhafra right now, I 
would have you thrown in jail!But you're so beautiful... *touches Alex's cheek*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!&nbsp;<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  Now, now, calm down. You should be honoured to be in the presence of the 
great Mayor of Alhafra. *caresses his cheek*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Oh, god, he's stroking me, someone get him away from me! *thrashes* 
Heeeelllllp!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  *kisses Alex deeply on the lips*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  Hic... ugh... BLAAAAARGH! *projectile vomits*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  I say! To cover me in your vomit is a most disgusting action indeed. How 
dare you!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  *is convulsing and foaming at the mouth. His eyes roll to the top of his 
head*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  You are not dying, are you? I forbid you from dying! Hey, are you listening? 
This is preposterous! I will not have any of this!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/alex.gif" width="32" />  *chokes on vomit and dies*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  ... I am utterly disgusted.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  What, is he dead already?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Wow, he died far too quickly. How disappointing.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  I am insulted! You had better replace these ruined clothes or I'll-<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Blah blah blah. This guy is so annoying.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Yeah, seriously. Just being in his presence is torture enough.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  You don't think we went too far?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Of course not!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Yeah, you're right. Hmm, what should we do with this obnoxious prat 
anyway?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Let's burn him. ^_^<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Sure. ^_^<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/AlhafraMayor.gif" width="32" />  Wait, what? Do you know who I am? I am none other than the Mayor of- 
Gyaaaaaaaaaah!<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  Aw, yeah, look at him burn.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  So beautiful. If anyone deserved to be tortured, it was that loathsome 
ass.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  I couldn't agree with you more.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" />  What on Weyard are you doing?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Burning the Alhafran Mayor of course.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" />  Weren't you supposed to be torturing Alex?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/saturos.gif" width="32" />  We did. See?<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/agatio.gif" width="32" />  ... You know what, I don't think I want to know what happened.<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/karst.gif" width="32" />  Nice one, sis. *high fives*<br />
<img height="32" src="../icons/menardi.gif" width="32" />  Hell, yeah.</p>
