now...<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Look at him, 
powdering his face, completely unaware...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why does he 
powder his face anyway?<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Beats the 
heck out of me.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> And all 
that hairgel he uses... disgusting...<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Have you 
seen all that shampoo he has? Awful.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What a 
freak.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I can't wait 
to torture him already.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Now for some 
lip gloss to emphasise my beautiful lips and- *sack is thrown over head* YIKES! 
*beaten unconscious*</p>

<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oog... my 
head... hurts...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Oh goody. 
You are awake.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Are you 
ready for your torture, Alex?<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Not really...<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Too bad. We 
brought in a special guest today.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yes. A 
fanbrat with a badfic she really wants to read to you.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Please... 
no...<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> OMG 
ALEX-CHAN UR SO HOT!!!1</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/jenna.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> May I say I 
object to this?<br>
<img src="../icons/mia.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Why do you 
hate this site so much?!<br>
<img src="../icons/ivan.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> First the 
hobo, now a fanbrat?<br>
<img src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What are you doing 
in the torture chamber? People want to see Alex being tortured!<br>
<img src="../icons/felix.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> By that 
thing?<br>
<img src="../icons/sheba.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Maybe you 
should torture Alex by making him look at your bad sprite edits.<br>
<img src="../icons/kyavatar.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Unless you all 
wish to be tortured, I suggest you leave.<br>
<img src="../icons/isaac.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... 
yeah... let's do that...<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> SAVE ME!<br>
<img src="../icons/piers.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Um... no.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Let's leave 
Alex with his new friend now.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Have "fun", 
Alex.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Great. I'm 
all alone with some fourteen year old fanbrat...<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> OMG! LOL! 
ALEX!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!! I'M ALONE WITH ALEX-CHAN! SQUEE!!!<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who the hell

<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> My name is 
Britney but I go on the Internet as alexsbaby4eva!<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... *hisses* 
I want to die already...<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I totally 
had this awesome dream last night. Like, it was about you, and you were naked 
and-<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's 
ENOUGH.<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ^_^ 
Anyway, those evil Proxian people-<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait, you 
think Proxians are <i>evil</i>?<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Yeah. ^_^ 
But you aren't.<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I would like 
you to meet a friend of mine. His name is logic.<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Logic? Is 
he one of your gay lovers? Do you have buttsex? Who tops?!<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... ... ...<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Ooh, is it 
a hawt secret?! Anyway, they said to read you a fanfic! So here it is! My Golden 
Sun Fanfic by alexsbaby4eva!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><i>Britney stomped up to her room, feeling quite anoyed. Her 
mean mother had just told her to tidy her room! OMG! Why was her mother so 
mean?! When Britney got to her room, she saw a glowing portal.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"A glowing portal!" cried Britney. She promptly jumped 
through the portal and was teleported to a very familiar looking world! Somehow 
she was in Weyard!</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Omigosh!" said Britney. "I'm in Weyard!"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Suddenly, a blue-haired man appeared! It was Alex! He walked 
up to Britney and gazed into her blue eyes, bluer then the ocean, and said, "I 
have been waiting for you." Britney gasped and fainted at his feet.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>When Britney awoke, she was in a soft and comfy bed. She sat 
up in confusion. "Where am I?"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"You are in my room," said Alex. "Welcome to Weyard, 
Princess."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Huh?" Britney was confused.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"You are not from Earth," said Alex. "You are actually the 
crown Princess of Lemuria. You were destined to return on this day. The 
Lemurians sent you to Earth, to protect you from the Senate, who wanted to claim 
your life."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Wait, wait," cried Britney in shock. "Are you saying I am 
the daughter of King Hydros?"</i></p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Enough! 
*blood pouring out of ears*</p>
<p align="left"><i>"Yes," replied Alex, nodding his head in a sagely manner. His 
beautiful blue eyes glittered and he leaned back, throwing back his beautiful 
glistening hair the colour of the sky. "You are Princess Amber Destiny Giselle, 
the only child of King Hydros of Lemuria. Finally, you have returned to Weyard 
and your destiny awaits you."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"M-my destiny?" Britney stuttered.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Alex got up and held a pendant, which he put around Britney's 
neck. Suddenly, she transformed. Her hair became a beautiful sun-kissed shade of 
blue, cascading in soft waves down her back. Her eyes became smokey emerald. Her 
plain face became beautiful. Her jeans and t-shirt changed to a long, flowing 
gown with ruffles. It was purple.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Oh, wow!" Britney jumped to her feet. "This is so sugoi!"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"You are as beautiful as I imagined, my hime," said Alex.</i></p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wait! What's 
a sugoi? Is hime some creepy pet name?<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> I decided 
to put in Japanese words to make it even COOLER!!!1<br>
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> ... *sobs* 
*blood spurts from ears*</p>
<p align="left"><i>"There is something I have not told you yet," Alex said, 
clasping her hands in his.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Nani?" asked Britney.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"When you were born, it was decided you would be married to a 
member of the Mercury Clan from Imil," said Alex.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Iya da!" cried Britney in surprise. "You mean we're going to 
marry each other?"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Hai," replied Alex. "We will marry right now. Too long have 
I waited to marry you, my koi."</i></p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's carp, 
damn it! CARP!!! *blood is now gushing in identical waterfalls from ears*</p>
<p align="left"><i>"I can't wait to marry you, Alex-chan!" cried Britney, her 
emerald eyes glittering.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>So Britney and Alex went outside to where a wedding marquee 
was waiting for them. Everybody in the game was present at the wedding except 
the people of Lemuria (except Piers, who was there) so Britney and Alex got 
married and everyone cheered for them.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Alex, can I ever go to Lemuria?" Britney asked as she 
passionately kissed her husband in bed.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Ie. I'm afraid not," said Alex in a regretful tone, cuddling 
up to her. He was sweaty from their hawt secks and feeling quite tired, but 
gazing into Britney's beautiful emerald eyes always re-energised him. "As long 
as the Senate still lives, you can never return home."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Why does the Senate want to kill me?" Britney asked.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Because you are royalty. The Senate is plotting to take over 
Lemuria and may kill your father to seize power. You are seen as a threat to 
them," said Alex. "I could not bear to see you die. Onegai, do not return to 
Lemuria."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Okay," sighed Britney.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Little did they know, the Senate knew of her return and was 
on their way over right now to kill her!</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"HA HA HA." yelled Conservato, jumping through the window 
when Alex and Britney were eating their breakfast together. "We have come to 
kill you, Princess Amber Destiny Giselle!"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Britney screamed. Alex stood in front of her protectively as 
the entire Senate jumped through the window and surrounded them. He warped out 
with her and they ran for it as the Senate of Lemuria gave chase, trying to kill 
the Princess!</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Onegai, go on ahead!" Alex pushed her away. "I will fight 
them alone!"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Ie!" Britney protested, her eyes sparkling with tears. 
"But... ai shiteru, Alex-chan..."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Just go!" Alex said, waving his sword and staring at the 
Senate as they came even closer.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Britney sobbed and ran away as Alex began to fight bravely 
against the Senate. He managed to take almost all of them down except Conservato. 
Then a sword plunged through his gut. Conservato laughed mockingly and walked 
away, leaving Alex in a pool of blood.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Britney ran sobbing and came to a stop, when she realised she 
was surrounded by Proxians. "ONOZ!" she screamed, as the evil red-eyed 
pointy-eared freaks advanced on her, laughing maniacally.</i></p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/alex.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> GAAAAAAAAAH!!!!! 
*dies of blood loss*</p>
<p align="left"><i>The evil Proxians carried the terrified Britney-</i></p>
<p align="left">
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> That's 
ENOUGH!<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Alex is 
quite dead now.<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> But I must 
read the rest of it to my dear Alex-chan!!! He loves it!!! SQUEE!<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Wow. I have 
seen true stupidity.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> She thinks 
we're evil and Alex is not? What's <i>wrong </i>with her?!<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> Who cares? 
Just kill the filthy thing.<br>
<img src="../icons/fanbrat.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> OMG WUT I 
KNEW YOU WERE-<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> *decapitates 
fanbrat with sickle* Good riddance.<br>
<img src="../icons/agatio.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> What a 
nightmare.<br>
<img src="../icons/karst.gif" height="32" border="0" width="32"> At least 
Alex suffered. He looks good in red, doesn't he?</p>
